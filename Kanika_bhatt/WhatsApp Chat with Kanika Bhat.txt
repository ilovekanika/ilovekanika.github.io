9/18/24, 9:15 PM - Kanika Bhat: Hi

-kanika bhatt
9/18/24, 9:15 PM - Kanika Bhat: How are you ?
9/18/24, 9:16 PM - Kanika Bhat: I had a doubt regarding the same,
Is this H+ rating only seen when i apply for a german public university or it is checked by all universities in Germany?
9/18/24, 9:41 PM - karthikpm52: Hey Kanika, German universities don't care about your university status.
9/18/24, 9:42 PM - karthikpm52: The importance of the university status, is to get an APS certificate. <This message was edited>
9/18/24, 9:42 PM - karthikpm52: Which is needed for your student visa.
9/18/24, 9:43 PM - karthikpm52: So if your university is H +/- or H- , it is said that you won't get an APS certificate.
9/18/24, 9:44 PM - karthikpm52: So in conclusion, it's needed for getting your visa.
9/18/24, 9:49 PM - karthikpm52: I hope I got your question right?
9/18/24, 10:17 PM - Kanika Bhat: APS or ATS ?
9/18/24, 10:19 PM - Kanika Bhat: Also,
Will i be required to do 1 year of diploma after my bachelors (3year) ?
9/19/24, 12:57 AM - Kanika Bhat: Also when will u be going to germany 🇩🇪 🥳
9/19/24, 7:28 AM - karthikpm52: It's APS dude.
9/19/24, 7:28 AM - karthikpm52: It's a document issued by german embassy.
9/19/24, 7:29 AM - karthikpm52: Basically they verify all your documents, like transcripts, 12th, 10th, passport etc.
9/19/24, 7:30 AM - karthikpm52: From there they will check, if the university is H+ or not.
9/19/24, 7:31 AM - karthikpm52: Ohhh that, since I am 4 year course I am not sure about that. But its possible with 3 years too i think.
9/19/24, 7:32 AM - karthikpm52: Your doing Bsc?
9/19/24, 7:32 AM - karthikpm52: Or BCA.
9/19/24, 7:33 AM - karthikpm52: Aah dude, summer applications started, but I am yet to give my ielts exam, I will mp start applying next month. Hope I would get any 🥲.
9/19/24, 7:33 AM - karthikpm52: I also need to apply for a credit card.
9/19/24, 7:34 AM - karthikpm52: Because Uni assist portal only works on credit card
9/19/24, 7:35 AM - karthikpm52: Fyi you need to pay 18k for the verification. So just verify your university status, otherwise i think there might be issues. ( Hope you remember how it's done ?  ) <This message was edited>
9/19/24, 7:37 AM - Kanika Bhat: Bca
9/19/24, 7:37 AM - karthikpm52: Consultancies make a huge fuss about APS, but it's not a big deal to get one.
9/19/24, 7:37 AM - Kanika Bhat: Yesss
9/19/24, 7:38 AM - Kanika Bhat: Actually the status of my uni is h+/- 
So im worried
9/19/24, 7:38 AM - karthikpm52: When are you graduating?
9/19/24, 7:38 AM - Kanika Bhat: 2025
9/19/24, 7:39 AM - karthikpm52: Acha it's bennet?
9/19/24, 7:39 AM - Kanika Bhat: Yes 😭
9/19/24, 7:39 AM - karthikpm52: H+/- means it's under the process of being H+ i think.
9/19/24, 7:39 AM - karthikpm52: Probably by 2025
9/19/24, 7:39 AM - karthikpm52: Maybe it would become H+
9/19/24, 7:40 AM - Kanika Bhat: Abhi naac rating nhi aaya hai bennett ka.
It should come by October
9/19/24, 7:40 AM - karthikpm52: Then tho it's fine.
9/19/24, 7:40 AM - karthikpm52: By the time you graduate it will become H+
9/19/24, 7:40 AM - karthikpm52: Dw

9/19/24, 7:41 AM - karthikpm52: Like asa hi hota hai.
9/19/24, 7:41 AM - karthikpm52: H+/- ka

9/19/24, 7:42 AM - Kanika Bhat: I will graduate by May 2025
9/19/24, 7:45 AM - karthikpm52: Then thats good.
9/19/24, 7:46 AM - karthikpm52: I am also doubtful about the loopholes in H+/- while applying for APS.
9/19/24, 7:46 AM - karthikpm52: Can you verify your course too.
9/19/24, 7:46 AM - karthikpm52: In anabin.
9/19/24, 7:47 AM - karthikpm52: I think then I think it wouldn't be an issue, if it's a 3 year one.
9/19/24, 7:47 AM - karthikpm52: Like some universities actually ask for a certain credit while applying.
9/19/24, 7:48 AM - Kanika Bhat: Bca is 3 year course with 120 credits
9/19/24, 7:58 AM - karthikpm52: Ok, i think 120 CS credits are enough.
9/19/24, 7:58 AM - karthikpm52: I have seen some universities asking for a similar number.
9/19/24, 7:59 AM - karthikpm52: Need to check, actually I don't even know how many credits does mine have.
9/19/24, 8:00 AM - karthikpm52: Btw I wanted to ask does bennet university not require any attendance policy after 2nd year?
9/19/24, 8:00 AM - karthikpm52: If you are doing some kind of an internship?
9/19/24, 8:01 AM - karthikpm52: I have a friend who studied there, but I always see him in  my hometown. Which really down south <This message was edited>
9/19/24, 8:02 AM - Kanika Bhat: Yes, this is true once u have an internship of more than 2 months within the same domain of your studies

2/22/25, 11:31 AM - Kanika Bhat: Mhm
2/22/25, 11:31 AM - karthikpm52: The thing is that, consultants will not do indepth research about the courses.
2/22/25, 11:32 AM - karthikpm52: Like they have multiple clients.
2/22/25, 11:32 AM - karthikpm52: And i think most of them, don't even have the analytical skills to shortlist universities, that match to your background.
2/22/25, 11:33 AM - karthikpm52: Mostly they will try to get you into a private university.
2/22/25, 11:33 AM - karthikpm52: Which imo is easy to get.
2/22/25, 11:33 AM - karthikpm52: I got an admit to SRH Heidelberg.

2/22/25, 11:34 AM - karthikpm52: After applying.
2/22/25, 11:34 AM - karthikpm52: Have to see, I mean fees is just 25k rs a sem right, but I'll try daad scholarship.
2/22/25, 11:35 AM - karthikpm52: And consultancy is pretty expensive too.
2/22/25, 11:39 AM - karthikpm52: I mean if you get a good consultancy then give it a try, but make sure that it's reputed.
2/22/25, 11:39 AM - karthikpm52: Although it's difficult.
2/22/25, 11:55 AM - Kanika Bhat: True
2/22/25, 11:55 AM - Kanika Bhat: Correct
2/22/25, 11:56 AM - Kanika Bhat: Hnn

2/22/25, 12:16 PM - Kanika Bhat: Yes
2/22/25, 12:17 PM - karthikpm52: You need to check if there are any public universities that takes 180 ECTS.
2/22/25, 12:18 PM - karthikpm52: Try applied to science universities also.
2/22/25, 12:19 PM - Kanika Bhat: Are applied sci. Uni public ones ?
2/22/25, 12:19 PM - karthikpm52: Yeah.
2/22/25, 12:19 PM - Kanika Bhat: Can u pls send me a list that u created while researching for uni?
2/22/25, 12:22 PM - karthikpm52: I didn't make one, I had a research background in visual computing, so I just found some german universities that offer visual computing and deep checked it's course requirements.
2/22/25, 12:22 PM - karthikpm52: And used my visual computing background to compensate my gpa.
2/22/25, 12:23 PM - karthikpm52: As I want to do a phd in the future.
2/22/25, 12:23 PM - karthikpm52: And I had a 240 ECTS.
2/22/25, 12:23 PM - karthikpm52: Since mine was a 4 year program.
2/22/25, 12:24 PM - karthikpm52: There were just 4 universities in the summer semester. <This message was edited>
2/22/25, 12:24 PM - karthikpm52: Your case is different from mine, 180 ECTS and gpa is good.
2/22/25, 12:28 PM - karthikpm52: So check which universities accept 180 ECTS and your high gpa might be useful to universities that require a high gpa cutoff.
2/22/25, 12:31 PM - karthikpm52: So that's all I can say for now.
2/22/25, 12:32 PM - karthikpm52: Dw you'll get in.
2/22/25, 2:44 PM - Kanika Bhat: Brooooo

2/23/25, 7:40 PM - Kanika Bhat: Which one is better?
2/23/25, 7:40 PM - karthikpm52: TUs are only research.
2/23/25, 7:40 PM - karthikpm52: Depends on what you want.
2/23/25, 7:40 PM - karthikpm52: You want to do research or do job.

4/11/25, 6:28 PM - karthikpm52: In siegen.
4/11/25, 6:29 PM - karthikpm52: Like 6 month internships are different from working student, it's full time, so they change their visa status also i think.

6/1/25, 12:42 PM - karthikpm52: And maybe might take you.
6/1/25, 12:43 PM - karthikpm52: You just have to get the entry barrier.
6/1/25, 12:43 PM - karthikpm52: Exactly
6/1/25, 12:43 PM - karthikpm52: You don't have to get everything correct.
6/1/25, 12:43 PM - karthikpm52: Anyways, I don't think i have time to get the visa.
6/1/25, 12:44 PM - karthikpm52: Like if you get selected for the test, it's one month before the class.
6/1/25, 12:44 PM - karthikpm52: So prolly need to postpone to summer.
6/1/25, 12:45 PM - karthikpm52: And i don't have time for summer.. Darmstadt can kiss my ass.

6/1/25, 12:46 PM - Kanika Bhat: 😭
6/1/25, 12:46 PM - karthikpm52: Like you don't need to have full credits for every subject.
6/1/25, 12:50 PM - karthikpm52: https://www.tu-darmstadt.de/studieren/studieninteressierte/internationale_studieninteressierte/bewerbung_und_zulassung_international/index.en.jsp

6/2/25, 7:40 PM - Kanika Bhat: Had to go somewhere for house work
6/2/25, 7:40 PM - karthikpm52: Aah then it's fine right.
6/2/25, 7:40 PM - karthikpm52: I mean don't have to worry about credits.
6/2/25, 7:41 PM - karthikpm52: From reddit, people are saying mostly everyone from India is getting the test.
6/2/25, 7:42 PM - Kanika Bhat: Ummm
But the attendance policy of TUD says that test will only be conducted in person. 
No remote setting.
6/2/25, 7:42 PM - karthikpm52: It's remote.
6/2/25, 7:42 PM - karthikpm52: Like you can take it remote too
6/2/25, 7:42 PM - karthikpm52: My friend took it.
6/2/25, 7:42 PM - karthikpm52: You have an application called owl.

6/2/25, 7:43 PM - karthikpm52: Like why stress, like TUD is very overcrowded.
6/2/25, 7:44 PM - karthikpm52: 200 students might be sitting in one lecture hall.
6/2/25, 7:44 PM - Kanika Bhat: Mhm?
6/2/25, 7:44 PM - Kanika Bhat: Ahaaaa ya
6/2/25, 7:44 PM - Kanika Bhat: Passau is good in that sense

6/2/25, 7:44 PM - karthikpm52: You will also be in a zoom meeting.
6/2/25, 7:44 PM - karthikpm52: If you face any technical issues.
6/2/25, 7:45 PM - karthikpm52: Yeah, restricted admission ones are good in that sense.. like lower cap.
6/2/25, 7:45 PM - Kanika Bhat: Oh
6/2/25, 7:45 PM - karthikpm52: Faculty student ratio is good.
6/2/25, 7:45 PM - Kanika Bhat: Chat gpt he chahiye😭
6/2/25, 7:45 PM - karthikpm52: Like TUD is good, if you are amazing and you don't need much help from faculties.
6/2/25, 7:45 PM - Kanika Bhat: True
But im a dumb kid
6/2/25, 7:46 PM - karthikpm52: I too siegen, because it's limited admission requirement.
6/2/25, 7:46 PM - karthikpm52: Like maximum 50 students.
6/2/25, 7:46 PM - Kanika Bhat: Niceee
6/2/25, 7:46 PM - Kanika Bhat: Passau is 30 ig
6/2/25, 7:46 PM - karthikpm52: And faculty interaction is good.
6/2/25, 7:46 PM - karthikpm52: Yeahh
6/2/25, 7:46 PM - karthikpm52: Faculties are good.
6/2/25, 7:47 PM - karthikpm52: If you maintain a good relationship, you can get some jobs.
6/2/25, 7:47 PM - Kanika Bhat: Ohhh TU D suddenly went down my priority
6/2/25, 7:47 PM - Kanika Bhat: True
6/2/25, 7:47 PM - karthikpm52: <Media omitted>
6/2/25, 7:47 PM - karthikpm52: This is the industry partners of siegen.
6/2/25, 7:47 PM - karthikpm52: Like it's really good.
6/2/25, 7:47 PM - Kanika Bhat: INDEED
6/2/25, 7:48 PM - karthikpm52: Like it's a top college in Germany.
6/2/25, 7:48 PM - karthikpm52: But it's not that big of a brand internationally.
6/2/25, 7:48 PM - karthikpm52: TUM and TUD can't be compared in terms of brand value.
6/2/25, 7:48 PM - Kanika Bhat: check out recruiters for Augsburg mcs cs elite program in collab with TUM and LMU
6/2/25, 7:49 PM - Kanika Bhat: Hmmmm
6/2/25, 7:49 PM - karthikpm52: I mean TUD is a big brand in Germany.
6/2/25, 7:49 PM - karthikpm52: Like if you apply people will notice you.
6/2/25, 7:49 PM - karthikpm52: But we have to fill some research work too.
6/2/25, 7:50 PM - karthikpm52: I think it's easy to get in a smaller cap uni.
6/2/25, 7:50 PM - karthikpm52: Like i don't want to compete with 500 students for a research project.
6/2/25, 7:50 PM - karthikpm52: Let me see.
6/2/25, 7:51 PM - karthikpm52: They might have better industrial collaboration.

6/4/25, 1:51 PM - karthikpm52: Alright.
6/4/25, 1:51 PM - karthikpm52: I'll start with strength.
6/4/25, 1:52 PM - Kanika Bhat: <Media omitted>
6/4/25, 1:53 PM - karthikpm52: 1. I feel extroverted is a good strength of yours, like you reach out and connect to people.
2. Chill person energy, so it is nice to hangout with probably.
3. Loyalty ( from your talks, I feel you are loyal lol .. don't have much data ) and you help people in whatever way you can. <This message was edited>
6/4/25, 1:55 PM - karthikpm52: So overall, you are good with people and managing them.
6/4/25, 1:56 PM - karthikpm52: Then let me go with threats.
6/4/25, 1:58 PM - Kanika Bhat: <Media omitted>
6/4/25, 2:00 PM - karthikpm52: 1. Potential to get manipulated, because i feel you are an open book ( or maybe not ) .. so easy to understand your trigger points for manipulation.
2. Befriending the wrong people, like you are always making friends that maybe, you might meet a covert narcissist or a bad person who is masked as a good guy/girl... Toxic af .. bad for mental health.
6/4/25, 2:01 PM - karthikpm52: Now imma go with opportunity.
6/4/25, 2:02 PM - karthikpm52: 1. Chill person energy is so easy to network with people physically.
2. Helpful person, so you will have people who might help you back.
All of this is good to get new jobs / opportunities ahead.
6/4/25, 2:03 PM - karthikpm52: Like people with people skills always win in life tbh.
6/4/25, 2:03 PM - karthikpm52: And now weakness.
6/4/25, 2:04 PM - Kanika Bhat: All true.

6/17/25, 9:16 PM - karthikpm52: Okay, like the way he is texting is like a creep.
6/17/25, 9:16 PM - karthikpm52: And i think since you are acting chill about it ( since you are a chill person ), he thinks you are agreeing to all of his filth, like he is getting an ego boost. <This message was edited>
6/17/25, 9:17 PM - karthikpm52: I would feel very unsafe, if I was with him ( from a female perspective)
6/17/25, 9:19 PM - karthikpm52: Hahhh that's fine, since he is not physically there, but uhhhhh something about him gives me goosebumps 😖 <This message was edited>
6/17/25, 9:20 PM - karthikpm52: And does he actually have a girlfriend? he sounds like a pathological liar tbh.
6/17/25, 9:22 PM - karthikpm52: And what sort of a weird analysis is this, like he wants to stay with a girl, but not with a guy .. but it shouldn't be a concern because he is not cheating on his gf ( then why care in the first place 😭 ) <This message was edited>
6/17/25, 9:24 PM - karthikpm52: It's like Gandhi ji sleeping with all those women, but on record he said he didn't do anything with them. <This message was edited>
6/17/25, 9:27 PM - karthikpm52: But then again, whatever you say won't matter, cuz he is blind lol.

6/18/25, 2:14 PM - karthikpm52: That's why I am saying, like if I study at siegen or TU Darmstadt for visual computing there is always a limit on what resources i have control on.
6/18/25, 2:14 PM - karthikpm52: I learnt that from my college.
6/18/25, 2:14 PM - karthikpm52: It's about what environment the college offers.

How did you collect data ?
Research methods

Motivation of that problem statement <This message was edited>
6/29/25, 9:50 PM - karthikpm52: There is no data, it's real time video processing.
6/29/25, 9:51 PM - karthikpm52: Deep learning slows down the process.
6/29/25, 9:51 PM - Kanika Bhat: Heading 1 must be YOUR PURPOSE
Because it is a statement of “purpose”

Then add why this Degree and then write about Stuttgart
6/29/25, 9:51 PM - karthikpm52: Just classical mathematical models.
6/29/25, 9:51 PM - karthikpm52: In the end it's there, like i talked about their labs.
6/29/25, 9:51 PM - karthikpm52: And how it's beneficial.
6/29/25, 9:51 PM - karthikpm52: But i think it's not that clear.
6/29/25, 9:52 PM - Kanika Bhat: Your sentences are too long. Make them simpler
6/29/25, 9:52 PM - Kanika Bhat: Because 
Your IELTS score should match your SOP
and if attend visa interview they will map
Your speaking skills of interview with your ielts and your SOP

And if u disappoint them
They might reject u
6/29/25, 9:53 PM - Kanika Bhat: Make this 1.5 page. Max
6/29/25, 9:54 PM - Kanika Bhat: Highlight a few important words
6/29/25, 9:54 PM - Kanika Bhat: To make it impactful
6/29/25, 9:54 PM - Kanika Bhat: Lemme send u my TU Darmstad’s AI ML SOP
6/29/25, 9:54 PM - karthikpm52: Yeah I am not gonna use that.. it was just the result of the prompts.
6/29/25, 9:55 PM - Kanika Bhat: <Media omitted>
6/29/25, 9:55 PM - Kanika Bhat: Good. U restructure it
6/29/25, 9:55 PM - Kanika Bhat: Or, put individual lines into AI and ask it for simple english and shorter lines.

That’ll also do
6/29/25, 9:56 PM - karthikpm52: You deleted this message
6/29/25, 9:56 PM - Kanika Bhat: Also, try to connect emotionally also a little.
Dont stay professional always.
6/29/25, 9:57 PM - Kanika Bhat: Add your german grade equivalent also with Indian CGPA
6/29/25, 9:57 PM - karthikpm52: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_2z0I4lRsQ360AfYkLZKcu8imanJ9qQgrKHFQed5JZU/edit?usp=drivesdk
6/29/25, 9:57 PM - Kanika Bhat: Add your chess awards also.

6/29/25, 9:58 PM - karthikpm52: I was restructuring it.
6/29/25, 9:58 PM - karthikpm52: Today morning.
6/29/25, 9:58 PM - Kanika Bhat: Okay i’ll read it
In the mean time go through my SOP
6/29/25, 9:58 PM - karthikpm52: Like i wanted to try something else.
6/29/25, 9:58 PM - karthikpm52: There isn't much to read in mine, I am just covering the heading.
6/29/25, 9:58 PM - karthikpm52: One by one.
6/29/25, 9:59 PM - karthikpm52: Just look into the topics that I am gonna cover
6/29/25, 9:59 PM - karthikpm52: Okk
6/29/25, 10:00 PM - Kanika Bhat: Also
U the heading
“Letter of Motivation”

Because thsts what university has written on website. 

If it has written “Purpose” then u need to be extremely concise and to the point. So u use “statement of purpose”

Its “a” statement of “purpose”

Its not same as “letter” of “motivation”

Only on 1X speed!

And extrapolate it in the terms of network optimisation.
7/10/25, 3:54 AM - Kanika Bhat: summary is =

The general approach to increase capacity on network traffics is by making more pathways.
Ie creating more subnetworks to reach from point A to B.

But this principle shown in video says it can lead to further jams also.

It suggests that by reducing redundant connections, we can optimise the buffering period and increase
Movement in traffic
7/10/25, 3:54 AM - Kanika Bhat: This can be a great way to make optimised blockchains

7/13/25, 2:00 PM - karthikpm52: Then I didn't go for it, because I had other plans.
7/13/25, 2:00 PM - karthikpm52: Then in college there was one.
7/13/25, 2:01 PM - karthikpm52: I talked for two years, i think she liked me too.
7/13/25, 2:01 PM - karthikpm52: But i was a bit preoccupied.
7/13/25, 2:01 PM - karthikpm52: So I didn't go for it.
7/13/25, 2:01 PM - karthikpm52: And then there was a 35 year old women too.
7/13/25, 2:01 PM - karthikpm52: We used hangout everyday.
7/13/25, 2:01 PM - Kanika Bhat: Nothing to flex here bro

7/13/25, 2:02 PM - karthikpm52: For 2 years
7/13/25, 2:02 PM - karthikpm52: It's not a flex.
7/13/25, 2:02 PM - karthikpm52: It's a fact.
7/13/25, 2:02 PM - Kanika Bhat: Whats your definition of crush
Ig theres a flaw in it😂
7/13/25, 2:02 PM - Kanika Bhat: 🤡 u into milfs
7/13/25, 2:02 PM - karthikpm52: Aaa that's why you didn't want to tell, people just piss off.
7/13/25, 2:02 PM - karthikpm52: And say some weird facts.
7/13/25, 2:03 PM - karthikpm52: And act like they are not.
7/13/25, 2:03 PM - Kanika Bhat: Its a fact that u hv erectile disfunction?😭😂
7/13/25, 2:03 PM - karthikpm52: Noo
7/13/25, 2:03 PM - karthikpm52: Like it's not a flex
7/13/25, 2:03 PM - karthikpm52: That's lust.
7/13/25, 2:03 PM - Kanika Bhat: Na naaa
Im not pissed off
I just dont leave any opportunity to troll u🤡
7/13/25, 2:03 PM - karthikpm52: I want intimacy.
7/13/25, 2:03 PM - Kanika Bhat: I agree
7/13/25, 2:03 PM - karthikpm52: Actually people do.
7/13/25, 2:03 PM - karthikpm52: Just a bit.
7/13/25, 2:04 PM - karthikpm52: Just hide with laughter.
7/13/25, 2:04 PM - karthikpm52: As it's different.
7/13/25, 2:04 PM - karthikpm52: From the traditional norm right now.
7/13/25, 2:04 PM - Kanika Bhat: Like
Intellectual deepa talks
Emotional availability 

These things r priority 
Then comes the goofy business
7/13/25, 2:04 PM - karthikpm52: Not necessarily. <This message was edited>
7/13/25, 2:04 PM - karthikpm52: It just happened that all.
7/13/25, 2:05 PM - karthikpm52: And she was not married.
7/13/25, 2:05 PM - karthikpm52: I'll keep it at that.
7/13/25, 2:05 PM - Kanika Bhat: But did she treat u like a son
Or like a friend?
7/13/25, 2:05 PM - karthikpm52: A friend.
7/13/25, 2:05 PM - Kanika Bhat: 😭😭😭
7/13/25, 2:05 PM - Kanika Bhat: Han thats good then
7/13/25, 2:06 PM - Kanika Bhat: But is south open to all this?
I meant
Y guys r more cultured than us
7/13/25, 2:06 PM - karthikpm52: No more questions bro. <This message was edited>
7/13/25, 2:06 PM - Kanika Bhat: Do u guys accept such things 
Even if its 
Live in relationships and all?
7/13/25, 2:06 PM - karthikpm52: There are things at the surface level.
7/13/25, 2:06 PM - Kanika Bhat: <Media omitted>
7/13/25, 2:07 PM - Kanika Bhat: Plans as in?
7/13/25, 2:07 PM - karthikpm52: Man not now..
7/13/25, 2:09 PM - Kanika Bhat: Oki 🥹
7/13/25, 2:09 PM - karthikpm52: I don't want to have that gossip topic.
7/13/25, 2:09 PM - Kanika Bhat: Gossip thodi na hai ye 😭
7/13/25, 2:09 PM - Kanika Bhat: Its just exchanging stories
7/13/25, 2:09 PM - karthikpm52: Nah these things become gossip later.
7/13/25, 2:10 PM - Kanika Bhat: Hnn u r right in this sense <This message was edited>
7/13/25, 2:10 PM - Kanika Bhat: So u r fully recovered now?
7/13/25, 2:10 PM - karthikpm52: Fuck man, you and vidit kinda opening me up slightly lol.
7/13/25, 2:10 PM - Kanika Bhat: Btw 
What happened to Your visa ? Whats the stauts
7/13/25, 2:11 PM - Kanika Bhat: Yayye🥳🥳
7/13/25, 2:11 PM - karthikpm52: 18th is my appointment
7/13/25, 2:11 PM - Kanika Bhat: Tbh
Even vidit was like u
During the start
7/13/25, 2:11 PM - karthikpm52: Tell me yours then?
7/13/25, 2:12 PM - Kanika Bhat: But then
I built trust
And now he tell me everything even if it would offend me
7/13/25, 2:12 PM - Kanika Bhat: But we embrace the fact ki
We r being true to each other
7/13/25, 2:12 PM - Kanika Bhat: Absolute naked personalities
No filters 
Not being pretentious etc..
7/13/25, 2:13 PM - karthikpm52: Yeah that's how a relationship works right.
7/13/25, 2:14 PM - Kanika Bhat: The good part of it is
Whenever im in trouble
He gives a solution that fits just right as per my personality.
Because he knows me, my past my future goals and he sees me grow.

Same goes for him.

But the bad part is…
Well
Using each other’s stories to get back at them
7/13/25, 2:15 PM - Kanika Bhat: But we r lucky and matured
We dont dont do that shit
7/13/25, 2:15 PM - Kanika Bhat: Ofc
We point out each other mistakes to make them better.. but we dont attack using each other’s past
7/13/25, 2:15 PM - Kanika Bhat: What do u wanna know?
7/13/25, 2:16 PM - karthikpm52: If I tell you what's wrong with you what comes to your head? <This message was edited>
7/13/25, 2:17 PM - Kanika Bhat: So yea
Even vidit used to play it safe.
By keeping his cards close to himself.
Being cautious of himself around me..

But he let he guards down gradually.
And i really am proud of it
7/13/25, 2:18 PM - Kanika Bhat: Nothing?
I’ll hear u 
I’ll introspect
I’ll either accept it
Or i’ll tell u the situation in detail which led me to being that kinda person.

But y should i take any offence ? U r telling me whats wrong in me, that’ll benefit me only na.

plus, i dont think u r  toxic critic guy. So im naturally open to take your criticism
7/13/25, 2:20 PM - Kanika Bhat: Ive seen u cheering me up also
So its not like u r always pointing out the bad in me.
So theres a balance. Hence no issues, if u tell me what’s wrong with me.

And fun fact,
I tend to ask this to people by myself only lol😂
Because ik
As im aging its difficult to change
So its better to change asap.
7/13/25, 2:20 PM - Kanika Bhat: Congratulations 🥳
7/13/25, 2:20 PM - karthikpm52: No sorry, it's like if say the following "what is wrong with you?" What would you think.
7/13/25, 2:21 PM - karthikpm52: Not like if I say what's wrong with you.
7/13/25, 2:22 PM - Kanika Bhat: Pehele toh mere dimaag mai joke ajayega 
I’ll simply see my face and i’ll be like
“Me my whole self is wrong bro 🤡😂”

But then i’ll be serious and I’ll introspect
7/13/25, 2:22 PM - Kanika Bhat: So umm
7/13/25, 2:23 PM - Kanika Bhat: 1st is 
I get angry a little too early.
7/13/25, 2:23 PM - Kanika Bhat: Im working on that by putting myself into situations which might cause anger in me
And then i try to stay calm
7/13/25, 2:23 PM - Kanika Bhat: 2nd is
Sometimes im too straight fwd..
7/13/25, 2:24 PM - Kanika Bhat: 3rd is
When it comes to work
I tend to become too professional and i lose my emotions..
7/13/25, 2:26 PM - Kanika Bhat: 4th is
I tend to fall for wrong people and people who might be harmful for me.

Like for eg:-
remember anshuman asking for money? For funding his germany goal?

I was like
Since im earning…
Why dont i give my 1 month salary to him.. 

And i told this to vidit, he was like
Dont.
He said, ki anshuman already has friends who r heavily funding him and u dont know him properly yet
7/13/25, 2:27 PM - karthikpm52: I mentioned that in your weakness lol.
7/13/25, 2:28 PM - Kanika Bhat: So basically 
Im sapiosexual 
I tend to support people who wanna grow 
Who love knowledge 
And i admire those people
7/13/25, 2:28 PM - karthikpm52: I thought sapiosexuals are into smart people
7/13/25, 2:29 PM - Kanika Bhat: So wjen anshuman told me about his goals on txt

Before i would rationally evaluate the feasibility of his goals
I was like
Lets fund him 🤡🤡🤡

But vidit saved me bhai
7/13/25, 2:29 PM - Kanika Bhat: Yup
7/13/25, 2:29 PM - karthikpm52: Fund me bitch.
7/13/25, 2:30 PM - Kanika Bhat: I tend to judge people
If they give stupid answers sometimes. 
Thats rare.
But i judge them
7/13/25, 2:30 PM - karthikpm52: So you judge yourself?
7/13/25, 2:30 PM - Kanika Bhat: Dont provoke me 😭😭
I will actually do then
7/13/25, 2:30 PM - Kanika Bhat: Fact:- Yes sometimes 😂
7/13/25, 2:31 PM - karthikpm52: That's good lol.
7/13/25, 2:31 PM - karthikpm52: Wait
7/13/25, 2:31 PM - karthikpm52: So from my talks..
7/13/25, 2:31 PM - karthikpm52: Do you think I need a gf?
7/13/25, 2:31 PM - Kanika Bhat: No
7/13/25, 2:31 PM - karthikpm52: Or to be in a relationship.
7/13/25, 2:31 PM - Kanika Bhat: No dont
7/13/25, 2:31 PM - karthikpm52: Why is that?
7/13/25, 2:32 PM - Kanika Bhat: Because i think
At this point
U cant handle career and gf both
7/13/25, 2:32 PM - Kanika Bhat: Primary reason:-
Your damn good sleep cycle will be ruined
7/13/25, 2:32 PM - karthikpm52: Ngl that's one primary reason why I don't like relationships that much.
7/13/25, 2:33 PM - karthikpm52: Not that I don't want to be in one.
7/13/25, 2:33 PM - Kanika Bhat: 2nd 
U need a matured woman
Preferably older than u because she’ll be stable.
So u wont need to listen to her rando rona
7/13/25, 2:33 PM - Kanika Bhat: I understand
7/13/25, 2:33 PM - karthikpm52: True
7/13/25, 2:35 PM - Kanika Bhat: And 
U yourself need to develop some sense of EQ..
Like
Idk your traits in this area rn

But from what i notice
I suggest ki
U cannot just joke around things and make the other one feel better…

It needs much more than that
7/13/25, 2:35 PM - Kanika Bhat: It can easily involve sacrificing your sleep to help your gf sleep properly because she might be so sad ki usko neend he naa aaye
She might be making scenarios in head and staying up all night.
7/13/25, 2:36 PM - Kanika Bhat: Like
I feel
As of now, u cannot deal with a person who tends to overthink
7/13/25, 2:36 PM - Kanika Bhat: Kyuki it takes energy to calm down an ogerthinker😂
7/13/25, 2:36 PM - Kanika Bhat: U r like
“It is what it is”
7/13/25, 2:38 PM - Kanika Bhat: So even if u find a woman who’s crazy like u
Sees happiness in things
And doesnt get sad easily
Or
Knows how to get happy when she’s sad..

U will still need to make some changes in u
And prolly she’ll also need to hv chsnges in herself
7/13/25, 2:42 PM - karthikpm52: My therapist said i have a high EQ.. but I just over analyse to the end of the discussion, and since it involves brain power i prioritize my wellbeing than some person I met for a few months.
7/13/25, 2:42 PM - karthikpm52: High as in good enough.
7/13/25, 2:43 PM - karthikpm52: Yeahh, that's actually true.. and right now I don't want to do that.
7/13/25, 2:44 PM - karthikpm52: Maybe not enough to understand any women lol
7/13/25, 2:47 PM - karthikpm52: Yeah i am an overthinker myself.. but i just learnt to shut myself down.
7/13/25, 2:47 PM - Kanika Bhat: I see
Thats good na?
Prioritising your health
7/13/25, 2:47 PM - karthikpm52: Like i get their rant.
7/13/25, 2:47 PM - karthikpm52: But i know it has no end.
7/13/25, 2:48 PM - karthikpm52: And it's just endless self validation and the only way to stop it is .. let them know that it's best to stop.
7/13/25, 2:48 PM - karthikpm52: Like some people like the overthinking and when someone justifies it.
7/13/25, 2:49 PM - karthikpm52: And calming it down.
7/13/25, 2:49 PM - Kanika Bhat: Dont do that..
Vidit also does it.
I make him speak up.
And at then end he feels light because we get on the same page.
And all he wanted was communication.
Even if he’s not able to express in words
I try to do that for him by guessing whats wrong and  then he vents out.

Its better than exploding due to pilled up things
7/13/25, 2:49 PM - karthikpm52: Yeah, but not good the best at times
7/13/25, 2:50 PM - Kanika Bhat: And i feel
Overthinking leads to wrong conclusions because think so much 
We either bring too many elements or we nullify everything
7/13/25, 2:50 PM - Kanika Bhat: Thats also true.
Im glad u yourself said this
Because it was getting difficult for me to tell kyuki there is no defined line for “healthy” and “unhealthy”
7/13/25, 2:51 PM - Kanika Bhat: Agreed 💯
7/13/25, 2:52 PM - Kanika Bhat: Yup.
And that’s actually a bad habit to develop.
Constant external validation reduces self confidence and rationale
7/13/25, 2:52 PM - Kanika Bhat: Bhai my therapist was an asshole

She said
“Why do u love your parents? You should detach from them”

I was like “…………?!”
7/13/25, 2:54 PM - Kanika Bhat: And my mom was having a veryyyyy bad time a a few years back..
She was legit depressed.
Theres no clinical proof 
But dad also took her to therapy once
She was feeling suicidal and all.

So when i told this to my therapist 
She was like
“God forbids nothing happens, but if your mom is feeling suicidal, its her right to end her life”

LIKE WTF ?!
7/13/25, 2:56 PM - Kanika Bhat: That was such a conspired statement given by her
And thank god bhai i didnt loose my rationality.

My primary goal has always been to make this a happy family..
She didnt focus on it at all.

She was like
“Detach from your parents” 🧠🤡
7/13/25, 2:57 PM - karthikpm52: I'll reply in a bit
7/13/25, 2:57 PM - karthikpm52: Keep the chats coming
7/13/25, 2:57 PM - Kanika Bhat: She was like
“Do u love them or u just attached to them?”

“Love has healthy boundaries, but attachments makes u irrational”

I agree with this.

But how can she say I should let my mom die bro
7/13/25, 2:58 PM - Kanika Bhat: So yea..
My money was wasted..
She was like
“Y do u love your parents”
I said 
“Cuz they r my parents?!”

Isse aage aur kya bolu mai😂
7/13/25, 3:00 PM - Kanika Bhat: So yea
My overall experience was “eh eh” cuz of this lady.

I’ll prolly try a male therapist next time.
I actually wanted to that in the first place only cuz i genuinely feel men are smarter than women 🤡

But i was a little shy so i opted for a female to begin with.
7/13/25, 3:02 PM - Kanika Bhat: Ab jab mera randi rona hoga 
Tab i’ll take therapy.. 
last month was shit. 
Legit shit for me. 
The 2nd most dark time ig. 

Now im again okay..
It takes time to feel helpless 😂 
So when i’ll feel this way i’ll take a male therapist
7/13/25, 3:27 PM - karthikpm52: Too much of everything is not good.. but i mean everyone is complicated, so it's alright.
7/13/25, 3:28 PM - karthikpm52: Yeah it's to them, I just say to stfu like whatever they say is not valid.
7/13/25, 3:28 PM - karthikpm52: To them or me.
7/13/25, 3:29 PM - karthikpm52: Maybe she was trying to get your reaction or probably new at this.
7/13/25, 3:29 PM - karthikpm52: Why am I thinking a dumb north indian woman there 😂 <This message was edited>
7/13/25, 3:30 PM - karthikpm52: That's actually very sad to hear.
7/13/25, 3:31 PM - karthikpm52: I think this is the phase where the ask you questions to record your reactions and make their notes about you.
7/13/25, 3:32 PM - karthikpm52: But a psychologist never gives personal options.
7/13/25, 3:32 PM - karthikpm52: They usually bring statements to provoke you and under you better.
7/13/25, 3:32 PM - karthikpm52: Like it's not a regular talk.
7/13/25, 3:32 PM - karthikpm52: It's to solve an issue.
7/13/25, 3:32 PM - karthikpm52: It's supposed to make you pissed.
7/13/25, 3:33 PM - karthikpm52: Because only then you will question your thoughts and feelings. ( Like why are you feeling this emotion, what is the underlying cause of this and all ). <This message was edited>
7/13/25, 3:33 PM - karthikpm52: Hence you should solve the issue.
7/13/25, 3:33 PM - karthikpm52: Like they identify the cause of problems.
7/13/25, 3:33 PM - karthikpm52: Then try exercises to solve it.
7/13/25, 3:34 PM - karthikpm52: Maybe it could be solved by you, or they have some other methods.
7/13/25, 3:35 PM - karthikpm52: It's not like that, there is just a good doctor. Women are also stupid as well as men, but both genders see life differently to whatever approach you like you should get to that. <This message was edited>
7/13/25, 3:38 PM - karthikpm52: If it's a big issue it's cool, otherwise it's not a big deal.. just move forward.
7/13/25, 3:52 PM - Kanika Bhat: Will see msg in a while byeee
7/13/25, 4:20 PM - Kanika Bhat: Why😂
7/13/25, 4:22 PM - Kanika Bhat: Yup

7/13/25, 4:22 PM - Kanika Bhat: She seemed too dumb to execute this
7/13/25, 4:23 PM - Kanika Bhat: True
7/13/25, 4:23 PM - Kanika Bhat: Yup
7/13/25, 7:50 PM - karthikpm52: I am not exactly sure hahaha
7/13/25, 7:50 PM - karthikpm52: It's just how you described it.
7/13/25, 7:51 PM - karthikpm52: Like i have met a lot of dumb northie aunties.
7/13/25, 7:51 PM - karthikpm52: Like they sounds a bit loud.
7/13/25, 7:52 PM - karthikpm52: Like they don't know how to chill.
7/13/25, 8:29 PM - Kanika Bhat: I agree
7/13/25, 8:29 PM - Kanika Bhat: 😂
7/13/25, 9:33 PM - karthikpm52: Hahaha

7/14/25, 12:41 PM - karthikpm52: Likes bikes even honk at people in the footpath. <This message was edited>
7/14/25, 12:42 PM - karthikpm52: Everyone curses at each other and fights.

7/14/25, 4:04 PM - karthikpm52: Why do you think that
7/14/25, 4:04 PM - karthikpm52: ?
7/14/25, 4:05 PM - karthikpm52: It's conditioning.
7/14/25, 4:05 PM - karthikpm52: Like
7/14/25, 4:05 PM - Kanika Bhat: I knew one girl
Her name is Naimal Rizvi
7/14/25, 4:05 PM - Kanika Bhat: She was artistic, pretty and calm
7/14/25, 4:05 PM - karthikpm52: Their parents force them to be like that.
7/14/25, 4:05 PM - Kanika Bhat: Really?
7/14/25, 4:05 PM - karthikpm52: As in the Qur'an women are supposed to be like that to please mention.
7/14/25, 4:05 PM - karthikpm52: *men
7/14/25, 4:06 PM - Kanika Bhat: Oh
7/14/25, 4:06 PM - Kanika Bhat: This kinda makes me hate men..
7/14/25, 4:06 PM - karthikpm52: I mean a lot of them are impressed.
7/14/25, 4:06 PM - karthikpm52: *oppressed
7/14/25, 4:06 PM - karthikpm52: Honey it's a paradise religion for men.
7/14/25, 4:07 PM - karthikpm52: Heaven is only for men
7/14/25, 4:07 PM - Kanika Bhat: Like
Women arent even physically that strong to hit men..
Then on top of that we r more emotional and empathetic..

But in many cultures we suffer a lot
7/14/25, 4:07 PM - karthikpm52: And yk whats heaven according to the Qur'an.
7/14/25, 4:07 PM - karthikpm52: When a guy goes to heaven or paradise.
7/14/25, 4:07 PM - karthikpm52: He gets 15 virgin women.
7/14/25, 4:07 PM - Kanika Bhat: Oh
7/14/25, 4:08 PM - karthikpm52: Ofc you should
7/14/25, 4:08 PM - Kanika Bhat: Disgusting!! Bhai
7/14/25, 4:08 PM - karthikpm52: I know
7/14/25, 4:08 PM - karthikpm52: But don't hate muslims
7/14/25, 4:08 PM - karthikpm52: They don't know
7/14/25, 4:08 PM - karthikpm52: They never read the real translation of the Qur'an.
7/14/25, 4:09 PM - Kanika Bhat: Does it not make u feel bad
Ki manhood is being this way
7/14/25, 4:09 PM - karthikpm52: It's in Arabic.
7/14/25, 4:09 PM - karthikpm52: My teacher told this to me
7/14/25, 4:09 PM - karthikpm52: He was an ex muslim.
7/14/25, 4:09 PM - karthikpm52: He practiced islam for years.
7/14/25, 4:09 PM - karthikpm52: And read the whole book.
7/14/25, 4:09 PM - karthikpm52: With proper meaning.
7/14/25, 4:10 PM - Kanika Bhat: Yes i dont. Dw.
Its just that, because of all the terror stories ive heard..
I just stay extra cautious when im in an area like Jama Mazjid

But none of my Muslim friends r like that.
They r all civilised
7/14/25, 4:10 PM - karthikpm52: Tbh I don't care.. I can't control those things.
7/14/25, 4:11 PM - karthikpm52: Even there are hindu scriptures that are not good
7/14/25, 4:11 PM - karthikpm52: Like manusmriti.
7/14/25, 4:11 PM - karthikpm52: According to that women should not be given indipendence.
7/14/25, 4:11 PM - Kanika Bhat: Idk about these 🥹
7/14/25, 4:11 PM - Kanika Bhat: 😠
7/14/25, 4:11 PM - karthikpm52: Like when a women is small,  she is taken care by the father, then the husband.
7/14/25, 4:12 PM - Kanika Bhat: Hn
7/14/25, 4:12 PM - karthikpm52: Like she can't have anything other than that.
7/14/25, 4:12 PM - Kanika Bhat: ☹️
7/14/25, 4:12 PM - karthikpm52: A women who is free leads to description of culture.
7/14/25, 4:12 PM - karthikpm52: This is a Hindu scripture.
7/14/25, 4:13 PM - Kanika Bhat: But nowdays
Being a Man is also getting  risky.

Alimony
Murder
Fake harassment charges etc..
7/14/25, 4:13 PM - Kanika Bhat: Oh
7/14/25, 4:13 PM - Kanika Bhat: Damn where can i read this?
7/14/25, 4:13 PM - karthikpm52: But Hinduism don't have a standard book, also Hinduism isn't even a religion.
7/14/25, 4:13 PM - karthikpm52: Manusmriti
7/14/25, 4:13 PM - Kanika Bhat: Then y tf is hinduism preferred?!
7/14/25, 4:14 PM - karthikpm52: Was it preferred, like pseudo Hinduism is a big deal in north.
7/14/25, 4:14 PM - karthikpm52: Like it's all for show, but none of them have read the books.
7/14/25, 4:14 PM - Kanika Bhat: Accha suno
Ttyl
Gtg For lunch
We just finalised all our curtains🥳🥳
7/14/25, 4:15 PM - karthikpm52: There is no Hinduism.
7/14/25, 4:15 PM - karthikpm52: It was just name given by the British.
7/14/25, 4:15 PM - karthikpm52: For non abhrahamic people.
7/14/25, 4:15 PM - karthikpm52: Like in kerala, we don't celebrate diwali or anything.
7/14/25, 4:15 PM - karthikpm52: Our festivals are very local.
7/14/25, 4:15 PM - karthikpm52: Our god's are very local.
7/14/25, 4:15 PM - karthikpm52: It was introduced later.
7/14/25, 4:15 PM - karthikpm52: By a king.
7/14/25, 4:16 PM - karthikpm52: He killed a lot of people
7/14/25, 4:16 PM - karthikpm52: To promote their shiva .
7/14/25, 4:16 PM - Kanika Bhat: U can keep throwing txt
I will read and reply later 
Byee
7/14/25, 4:16 PM - karthikpm52: Killed vishnu devotees too!
7/14/25, 4:16 PM - karthikpm52: It's just which god is better !
7/14/25, 4:16 PM - Kanika Bhat: Btw pls dont start barking yet 😂
Else your throat will get fucked again
7/14/25, 4:17 PM - karthikpm52: True haha.

7/14/25, 4:19 PM - karthikpm52: This is the translations of iskon on various phrases.
7/14/25, 4:19 PM - karthikpm52: Look how they are putting fear in their texts for us to follow.
7/14/25, 4:20 PM - karthikpm52: <Media omitted>
7/14/25, 4:20 PM - karthikpm52: I can send you some manusmriti texts.
7/14/25, 4:20 PM - karthikpm52: Lol why do I sound like I am starting an religion of my own 😂
7/14/25, 4:21 PM - karthikpm52: A religion is bad if it takes away the freedom of question.. there are phrases in Hinduism that promotes it, but we have to search it.
7/14/25, 4:22 PM - karthikpm52: There are really bad stuff found in scriptures as well as good stuff.. but it's our job to not to get brainwashed by an institution.
7/14/25, 4:25 PM - karthikpm52: <Media omitted>
7/14/25, 4:33 PM - karthikpm52: <Media omitted>
7/14/25, 4:39 PM - karthikpm52: If you are following a baba, then just make sure their ashram allows questioning.
7/14/25, 4:40 PM - karthikpm52: Because true knowledge can only be gained like that, the gita is an amazing book, but it's not a book that is meant to be a book of fear.
7/14/25, 4:42 PM - karthikpm52: <Media omitted>
7/14/25, 4:42 PM - karthikpm52: These are the some popular ways of worship.
7/14/25, 4:43 PM - karthikpm52: Iskon talks about Atma-nivendanam.
7/14/25, 4:43 PM - karthikpm52: It's alright to follow it, but you have to be careful.. mostly yogis do it in solitude. <This message was edited>
7/14/25, 4:46 PM - karthikpm52: But the core nature of these practices is to get rid of ignorance and understanding one self.
7/14/25, 4:47 PM - karthikpm52: Which can be done by understanding nature through proper reasoning.
7/14/25, 4:49 PM - karthikpm52: Detaching from everything and looking at things abstractly.. even if it's a religion or practice you follow.
7/14/25, 4:53 PM - karthikpm52: This is buddi yog.. talked in the gita.
7/14/25, 4:53 PM - karthikpm52: The goal is to get rid of differentiation.
7/14/25, 4:54 PM - karthikpm52: Differentiation causes fights.
7/14/25, 4:55 PM - karthikpm52: Religious segregation, language segregation, caste segregation, gender segregation, pain misery etc.
7/14/25, 4:55 PM - karthikpm52: Once we can't find the difference to all of this ( see everyone and everything as the same ), that means you have tackled ignorance. <This message was edited>
7/14/25, 4:56 PM - karthikpm52: There is a lot more to understand!
7/14/25, 4:57 PM - karthikpm52: In this domain.
7/14/25, 4:57 PM - karthikpm52: So I don't put emotions with religion, cuz I am still understanding it.

Woof woof 🥹
7/14/25, 5:03 PM - karthikpm52: It's alright!
7/14/25, 5:04 PM - Kanika Bhat: <Media omitted>
7/14/25, 5:06 PM - karthikpm52: Summary, religion talks about liberation, but it can only be done by understanding nature ( science/ questioning ) .. now religion is used as tool of violence!
7/14/25, 5:06 PM - Kanika Bhat: What r u doing rn?
7/14/25, 5:06 PM - Kanika Bhat: I agree
7/14/25, 5:06 PM - karthikpm52: So humanity >>>>> religion
7/14/25, 5:07 PM - karthikpm52: I came back from class.
7/14/25, 5:07 PM - karthikpm52: Just relaxing.
7/14/25, 5:07 PM - karthikpm52: Why do I sound like vidit
7/14/25, 5:07 PM - Kanika Bhat: We cant learn without questioning and counter questioning..
And people get offended if u question religion..

They think we r insulting
No, we r just trying to understand it.
7/14/25, 5:07 PM - Kanika Bhat: Absolutely right
7/14/25, 5:08 PM - Kanika Bhat: In what sense?
7/14/25, 5:08 PM - karthikpm52: Just relaxing
7/14/25, 5:08 PM - Kanika Bhat: Oh yess how is it going?
7/14/25, 5:08 PM - Kanika Bhat: U both got lazy ass then😂
7/14/25, 5:09 PM - karthikpm52: Yeah, so now religion is all about ignorance ..  but islam dosent support questioning.
7/14/25, 5:09 PM - Kanika Bhat: Btw vidit is up for the project
7/14/25, 5:09 PM - Kanika Bhat: Oh 😲
7/14/25, 5:09 PM - karthikpm52: Because if you stop questioning then, you can control them.
7/14/25, 5:10 PM - karthikpm52: Why do you think a lot of dumb people vote for a party.
7/14/25, 5:10 PM - karthikpm52: It's based of religious inclination. <This message was edited>
7/14/25, 5:10 PM - karthikpm52: I see.
7/14/25, 5:11 PM - karthikpm52: I can't promise anything.. like my priorities are german prep and getting back with my computer vision books.
7/14/25, 5:11 PM - karthikpm52: Not that everything is going perfectly lol.
7/14/25, 5:11 PM - karthikpm52: True haha.
7/14/25, 5:12 PM - Kanika Bhat: I can talk but i dont hv the brain power to read the previous msg

7/14/25, 5:12 PM - Kanika Bhat: Agreed
7/14/25, 5:12 PM - karthikpm52: Ik it's a lot of texts 😂
7/14/25, 5:12 PM - Kanika Bhat: Aka Dictatorship
7/14/25, 5:12 PM - Kanika Bhat: Aka dictatorship ***
7/14/25, 5:12 PM - karthikpm52: Yeah, so don't think Hinduism is the best without reading anything.
7/14/25, 5:13 PM - Kanika Bhat: It was supposed to be the reply of this msg lol
7/14/25, 5:13 PM - karthikpm52: Like everyone thinks their religion is the best.
7/14/25, 5:13 PM - Kanika Bhat: Hn
7/14/25, 5:13 PM - Kanika Bhat: Oki
7/14/25, 5:13 PM - Kanika Bhat: Y?

7/14/25, 6:26 PM - karthikpm52: Are bro .. muje kyu problem hoga 🙂
7/14/25, 7:47 PM - Kanika Bhat: This all is so much to read 🥹
7/14/25, 7:47 PM - Kanika Bhat: 😡
7/14/25, 7:47 PM - Kanika Bhat: Karthikism >>>
7/14/25, 7:48 PM - Kanika Bhat: O isee
7/14/25, 7:48 PM - Kanika Bhat: I agree 
Ig that’s what Sanatan is
7/14/25, 7:50 PM - Kanika Bhat: Ahaaa ohhh 😮
7/14/25, 7:52 PM - Kanika Bhat: But what if someone focuses on violence or bad things.
Destructive things..

Will krishna still give them reward?
7/14/25, 7:53 PM - Kanika Bhat: Does that female friend pf yours really believe in all that?
No freedom for women
7/14/25, 7:55 PM - Kanika Bhat: Ohhh nice
7/14/25, 7:56 PM - Kanika Bhat: But things should be understood as absolute terms as well as in relative terms no?
7/14/25, 7:56 PM - Kanika Bhat: But it gives us the sense of differentiating whats wrong and right
7/14/25, 7:58 PM - Kanika Bhat: Maybe 
“Divide” and “differentiate” are two different things.

“Divide” causes fights
But ability to “differentiate” things makes us rational and aware.

Thats just my concept..
Maybe its just a word play
7/14/25, 7:59 PM - Kanika Bhat: Wth..
7/14/25, 8:01 PM - Kanika Bhat: U wont believe 
But I actually judge people of they vote to some stupid party.

It tells alot about their mentality 

Whom do u vote?
7/14/25, 8:02 PM - Kanika Bhat: Ya i dont think this..
We can actually never say that a particular religion is the best
7/14/25, 8:03 PM - Kanika Bhat: Oye i dont like death jokes okay? Shut up
7/14/25, 8:03 PM - Kanika Bhat: I dont like any jokes where i get separated from my friends and family
7/14/25, 8:03 PM - Kanika Bhat: 😅
7/14/25, 8:04 PM - Kanika Bhat: <Media omitted>

7/14/25, 8:34 PM - Kanika Bhat: Its not hinduism
It focuses on taking the good part of every religion
7/14/25, 8:35 PM - karthikpm52: That's no relevant they misrepresent gita, and say to do this violence inorder to save dharma.
7/14/25, 8:36 PM - karthikpm52: What are those religions?
7/14/25, 8:36 PM - Kanika Bhat: Idk

I just like to build good habits and contribute good things to world.. thats all.
7/14/25, 8:37 PM - karthikpm52: Not a friend she was a devotee of iskon, she left video gaming and all... According to her a certain iskon saint refused her to be reincarnated as a lowly irrelevant creature.
7/14/25, 8:37 PM - Kanika Bhat: Wth?
7/14/25, 8:38 PM - Kanika Bhat: No offence 
But how can she randomly believe a person who says that she cant be reincarnated cuz she is lowkey irrelevant?

7/14/25, 8:39 PM - Kanika Bhat: Ok gotcha
7/14/25, 8:39 PM - karthikpm52: Aah I see, then let's not talk about it.
7/14/25, 8:39 PM - karthikpm52: I just don't like religion as such, but I love learning about it.

Fear and Hope is a business
7/14/25, 8:42 PM - karthikpm52: All religious institutions work like that.
7/14/25, 8:42 PM - karthikpm52: To make money and control.
7/14/25, 8:43 PM - karthikpm52: Why should there be a party that wants development when they can get power by influencing stupid people.. all they want is power, just vote for any party that you have a slight inclination to :)

7/15/25, 5:53 PM - karthikpm52: I just read the summary.
7/15/25, 5:53 PM - Kanika Bhat: I like it
7/15/25, 5:53 PM - karthikpm52: Like they always talk about one idea
7/15/25, 5:53 PM - karthikpm52: And just illustrations.
7/15/25, 5:53 PM - karthikpm52: Self help books that is.
7/15/25, 5:53 PM - Kanika Bhat: Ya
7/15/25, 5:53 PM - karthikpm52: I read this book hyper focus.
7/15/25, 5:53 PM - karthikpm52: Never worked tbh.
7/15/25, 5:54 PM - karthikpm52: It didn't go with my lifestyle.
7/15/25, 5:54 PM - Kanika Bhat: My first one was 
The alchemist,
Power of subconscious mind,
Attitude is everything,
7/15/25, 5:54 PM - Kanika Bhat: Ya ik that one
Ive heard it
7/15/25, 5:54 PM - karthikpm52: Like it was kinda factored with the authors workflow.
7/15/25, 5:54 PM - karthikpm52: Yeah i know these.
7/15/25, 5:55 PM - karthikpm52: But haven't read them.
7/15/25, 5:55 PM - karthikpm52: But the title says a lot.
7/15/25, 5:55 PM - karthikpm52: 😂
7/15/25, 5:55 PM - Kanika Bhat: Yup😂
7/15/25, 5:55 PM - karthikpm52: I read the bhagwad gita
7/15/25, 5:55 PM - karthikpm52: It takes some time.
7/15/25, 5:55 PM - karthikpm52: So I don't spend that time in other books.
7/15/25, 5:56 PM - karthikpm52: Like i finished the iskon translation
7/15/25, 5:56 PM - Kanika Bhat: Man i wanna read it
But 
I wanna be regular with it.
7/15/25, 5:56 PM - karthikpm52: It's trash.
7/15/25, 5:56 PM - karthikpm52: I am going with Swami chimayas one now.
7/15/25, 5:56 PM - karthikpm52: He has a good introduction
7/15/25, 5:56 PM - karthikpm52: On the mind.
7/15/25, 5:56 PM - Kanika Bhat: But do u only read these books?
7/15/25, 5:56 PM - Kanika Bhat: And im not regular with reading books
7/15/25, 5:57 PM - karthikpm52: Which makes it easy to understand the psychology of the elements of the book.
7/15/25, 5:57 PM - karthikpm52: As in people.
7/15/25, 5:57 PM - karthikpm52: Like ?
7/15/25, 5:57 PM - karthikpm52: It's a very intensive book.
7/15/25, 5:58 PM - karthikpm52: To understand it takes time.
7/15/25, 5:58 PM - karthikpm52: I don't focus on memorizing the sanskrit bullishit.
7/15/25, 5:58 PM - karthikpm52: I focus on what the texts are trying to explain.
7/15/25, 5:58 PM - Kanika Bhat: Yup
7/15/25, 5:59 PM - Kanika Bhat: The holistic books
7/15/25, 5:59 PM - karthikpm52: I know some idiot who read the Slokas and think they are cool, but they are idiots.
7/15/25, 5:59 PM - karthikpm52: Mhmm ... Good question.
7/15/25, 5:59 PM - karthikpm52: Didn't think about it that much 😂
7/15/25, 6:00 PM - karthikpm52: Like idw i had this thing that true knowledge is hidden somewhere.
7/15/25, 6:00 PM - Kanika Bhat: Hnn
The meaning and execution of the teachings are important.. but not memorising the shloka
7/15/25, 6:00 PM - karthikpm52: I just keep searching.
7/15/25, 6:00 PM - karthikpm52: For something.
7/15/25, 6:00 PM - karthikpm52: Whether it's bible , Qur'an, or the gita.
7/15/25, 6:00 PM - karthikpm52: They are trying to explain something.
7/15/25, 6:01 PM - karthikpm52: I started with the gita, and some basic scripts in Hinduism.
7/15/25, 6:01 PM - karthikpm52: But it's too much to dig.
7/15/25, 6:01 PM - karthikpm52: So i just kept digging.
7/15/25, 6:01 PM - karthikpm52: My grandmother read the Qur'an she had told me some verses.. about god's solders.
7/15/25, 6:02 PM - karthikpm52: And a selected people to protect the religion or something.
7/15/25, 6:02 PM - karthikpm52: But i didn't couldn't focus much on that.
7/15/25, 6:03 PM - karthikpm52: I am giving irrelevant detail sorry.
7/15/25, 6:03 PM - karthikpm52: So yeah, now that you told me.. ig I am more focused on this.
7/15/25, 6:03 PM - karthikpm52: And I didn't know.
7/15/25, 6:03 PM - karthikpm52: The last fiction I read was raavan by amrish Tripathi.
7/15/25, 6:04 PM - karthikpm52: And ravens gate by Anthony howards.
7/15/25, 6:04 PM - karthikpm52: Exactly!
7/15/25, 6:05 PM - karthikpm52: I mean it's pretty self understandable, but there are pretty ignorant people.
7/15/25, 6:08 PM - Kanika Bhat: Na na chill im listening
7/15/25, 6:09 PM - Kanika Bhat: Is it fiction?
7/15/25, 6:10 PM - Kanika Bhat: <Media omitted>
7/15/25, 6:20 PM - karthikpm52: haaaa
7/15/25, 6:20 PM - karthikpm52: my phone died haha
7/15/25, 6:23 PM - karthikpm52: introspection is there ... but the depth of each verse has connections with a lot of Vedic scriptures.
7/15/25, 6:23 PM - karthikpm52: therefore you need a proper guru to understand the gita.
7/15/25, 6:24 PM - karthikpm52: but now there are interpretations of the gita by a lot of gurus.
7/15/25, 6:24 PM - karthikpm52: so they will explain the slokas with its necessary connections with the vedas, and puranas.
7/15/25, 6:25 PM - karthikpm52: like gita is like a crash course of all existing spiritual knowledge in all the books.
7/15/25, 6:25 PM - karthikpm52: thats what makes it intensive.
7/15/25, 6:27 PM - karthikpm52: but i still doubt the purity, since i dont know Sanskrit.
7/15/25, 6:28 PM - karthikpm52: but there are stuff in it which is no easy to practice also.
7/15/25, 6:29 PM - karthikpm52: do you have bhawad gita as it is?
7/15/25, 6:29 PM - karthikpm52: or any other on?
7/15/25, 6:29 PM - karthikpm52: as it is, is by padupada from iskon.
7/15/25, 6:30 PM - karthikpm52: I am still figuring it out better .. i read the whole thing .. but there are a lot of stuff i dont get .. so dont want to comment a lot about it too!
7/15/25, 6:33 PM - karthikpm52: i remember reading some controversial statements in 10th grade .. and i had left reading the book altogether, but i don't remember what it is now.. so i am reopening it again.
7/15/25, 6:34 PM - karthikpm52: maybe i was too young to understand it.
7/15/25, 6:34 PM - karthikpm52: well
7/15/25, 6:34 PM - karthikpm52: back then.
7/15/25, 6:35 PM - karthikpm52: its an amazing book
7/15/25, 6:35 PM - karthikpm52: you will understand how much of a goat raavan was.
7/15/25, 6:35 PM - karthikpm52: how sad his life is.
7/15/25, 6:37 PM - karthikpm52: like he was a bhraman, and he knew many disiplines - science, spirutatlity and music.
7/15/25, 6:37 PM - Kanika Bhat: Exactly 
There proper classes for gita
7/15/25, 6:37 PM - Kanika Bhat: Ohhh

7/16/25, 10:18 PM - karthikpm52: Like then i learnt that everyone is emotionally unavailable.
7/16/25, 10:18 PM - karthikpm52: So why give a shit about them.
7/16/25, 10:18 PM - karthikpm52: Whoever stays will stay.
7/16/25, 10:19 PM - karthikpm52: Like i be their friend.
7/16/25, 10:19 PM - Kanika Bhat: Hn
7/16/25, 10:19 PM - karthikpm52: And try my best to maintain it.
7/16/25, 10:19 PM - karthikpm52: But then sometimes it's best to let go.
7/16/25, 10:20 PM - karthikpm52: But then i later understood
7/16/25, 10:20 PM - karthikpm52: That people are also busy.
7/16/25, 10:20 PM - karthikpm52: I should respect their space.
7/16/25, 10:20 PM - karthikpm52: So I just learnt to wait
7/16/25, 10:20 PM - karthikpm52: And he patient.
7/16/25, 10:20 PM - karthikpm52: *be
7/16/25, 10:21 PM - Kanika Bhat: But then 
My natural personality IS to be there for my friends

I dont wanna lose myself cuz the world seems cold.

I dont think it is..
I feel people just say certain lines to show themselves as a victim..

“Mai depressed hu”
“Hamesha mere saath he hota h”
“People dont care”
“No one loves me”

Bhai i feel all these lines r nonsense..
7/16/25, 10:21 PM - karthikpm52: It didn't happen overnight.
7/16/25, 10:21 PM - karthikpm52: Took years.
7/16/25, 10:21 PM - karthikpm52: Of introspection.
7/16/25, 10:21 PM - karthikpm52: Exactly.
7/16/25, 10:21 PM - Kanika Bhat: People don’t introspect y others behave with them in a particular way.

They just blame the whole world by saying its cold
7/16/25, 10:22 PM - karthikpm52: Actually I feel that too!
7/16/25, 10:22 PM - karthikpm52: Like everyone is busy being a victim.
7/16/25, 10:22 PM - Kanika Bhat: So thats y
Cuz i dont wanna lose myself,
I find it hard to differentiate who’s real and who’s not real
7/16/25, 10:22 PM - karthikpm52: And treating others like shit. <This message was edited>
7/16/25, 10:22 PM - karthikpm52: I am sorry that happened to them, but why am I being the outlet.
7/16/25, 10:24 PM - Kanika Bhat: Hn
Thats still a reasonable reason.
Instead of saying “people r numb”
Its better to say “busy” cuz world is indeed hyper competitive.

But then again, priorities, and taking time for those priorities IS real relations
7/16/25, 10:25 PM - Kanika Bhat: Gimme 5mins bro
I got lots of content to rant on this
7/16/25, 10:25 PM - karthikpm52: Sure
7/16/25, 10:25 PM - Kanika Bhat: Fuck its 10:25 😭😭😭😭
7/16/25, 10:25 PM - Kanika Bhat: Aaahahahahahaaaaa
7/16/25, 10:25 PM - Kanika Bhat: U’ll sleep now
7/16/25, 10:26 PM - karthikpm52: Nahh it's fine go on.
7/16/25, 10:27 PM - karthikpm52: It was just the phases. <This message was edited>
7/16/25, 10:27 PM - karthikpm52: From early teen, to late teens, then to early adulthood.
7/16/25, 10:28 PM - Kanika Bhat: Yo no
7/16/25, 10:28 PM - karthikpm52: If someone doesn't reply, I just assume they are busy .. if they are always late to reply and say some generic reason I assume, I am not in their high profile chats lol.
7/16/25, 10:31 PM - Kanika Bhat: <Media omitted>
7/16/25, 10:32 PM - Kanika Bhat: High five ✋🏻

7/16/25, 10:36 PM - Kanika Bhat: <Media omitted>
7/16/25, 10:36 PM - karthikpm52: Bhai, you have the most correct approach to this.. like i don't even know why people think like this, like I am busy so I won't message, now I am not so .. I can message.
7/16/25, 10:36 PM - Kanika Bhat: Exactly
7/16/25, 10:37 PM - karthikpm52: And you are actually chill Bhai, like talking to you is fun .. like talking to that bengali girl ( the childhood friend) like it's so empty draining! Like constant validation and victim blaming..
7/16/25, 10:37 PM - Kanika Bhat: <Media omitted>
7/16/25, 10:38 PM - karthikpm52: Nicee
7/16/25, 10:38 PM - Kanika Bhat: Whats empty draining ?

7/16/25, 10:38 PM - karthikpm52: Fukkk it's emotionally draining ( ye sala auto complete)
7/16/25, 10:40 PM - karthikpm52: Hahaha it's chill, call me if you want.. around 6:35.. idk I am mostly afk or not.
7/16/25, 10:41 PM - Kanika Bhat: <Media omitted>
7/16/25, 10:41 PM - karthikpm52: Like at least it won't be emotionally draining like other ones... Like i told you about someone who gives me 10 missed calls per day!
7/16/25, 10:41 PM - Kanika Bhat: No idk this case
7/16/25, 10:42 PM - karthikpm52: Like i don't like calls, as idk I can't find the appropriate time to pick up.. but since you are chill, I give you this privilege.
7/16/25, 10:42 PM - karthikpm52: To call
7/16/25, 10:46 PM - Kanika Bhat: Huh 💅🏻

7/16/25, 10:48 PM - Kanika Bhat: What was the reason of her death if i may ask?
7/16/25, 10:49 PM - karthikpm52: Like she was bedridden.

7/16/25, 10:50 PM - karthikpm52: Idk she died a very bad death.
7/16/25, 10:50 PM - karthikpm52: I didn't think about it then.
7/16/25, 10:50 PM - karthikpm52: I just realised it now. <This message was edited>
7/16/25, 10:51 PM - karthikpm52: And I didn't have much emotion when she passed away, like i wasn't sad or anything.
7/16/25, 10:51 PM - karthikpm52: But when I saw her.
7/16/25, 10:51 PM - karthikpm52: In front of me.
7/16/25, 10:51 PM - karthikpm52: I got very sad.

7/17/25, 8:17 PM - Kanika Bhat: Hannnn correct
7/17/25, 8:17 PM - Kanika Bhat: That’s y education is important
7/17/25, 8:17 PM - Kanika Bhat: To atleast not let someone stay stupid and unaware their whole life
7/17/25, 8:19 PM - karthikpm52: But why should they! When you can make them stupid to  get the job done.. once you focus on science and technology.. it will lead to aethests, hence difficult to control or manipulate.
7/17/25, 8:20 PM - karthikpm52: Like if some politician fucks up, they can distract them, with what sushant singh rajput did one day before sucide.
7/17/25, 8:21 PM - karthikpm52: Aur India's got latent controversy.
7/17/25, 8:22 PM - Kanika Bhat: And hyper competition in everything
7/17/25, 8:22 PM - karthikpm52: But yes if everyone goes for a quality education, then our country will get better.
7/17/25, 8:22 PM - karthikpm52: Since it will lead to politicians with a good background.
7/17/25, 8:22 PM - karthikpm52: In economics, ya policy making.
7/17/25, 8:23 PM - Kanika Bhat: What did he do one day before death?

And pls dont call it suicide
Ik the case is officially closed but its not suicide..
It was murder
7/17/25, 8:23 PM - karthikpm52: Who understands shit.
7/17/25, 8:23 PM - Kanika Bhat: His assistant was thrown onto road from a tall building 

No sure if she was an assistant tho
7/17/25, 8:23 PM - Kanika Bhat: Yup

7/17/25, 8:24 PM - Kanika Bhat: Adaptability is very important
7/17/25, 8:25 PM - Kanika Bhat: I admire Amoeba for that.
🦠 
Its so adaptive, it changes its form, with thr dynamics of the situation
7/17/25, 8:25 PM - karthikpm52: Alright it was murder, but the media just used it to pump out some controversy of Amit Shah regarding some bill that discards a certain religion, and scams by NTA.
7/17/25, 8:26 PM - karthikpm52: And what happened some people got arrested on false accusations, got released.
7/17/25, 8:26 PM - Kanika Bhat: Theres a book called “fluid” 
It talks about mental agility and elasticity of brain
7/17/25, 8:26 PM - karthikpm52: And once everyone forgot about the government fuck up, they just left. <This message was edited>

I dont wanna hurt them unnecessarily just cuz my life was ripping apart.
7/18/25, 8:28 PM - Kanika Bhat: There was one night,
When i just couldn’t stop crying
I knew Nirbhay had a night job shift
So i texted him out of no where
I just wanted someone to interact with.

And u woke up at that time😂 and u and nirbhay were discussing south indian movies in morning..
7/18/25, 8:29 PM - karthikpm52: I agree it's gonna cause a lot of problems to them.

7/18/25, 8:31 PM - Kanika Bhat: Last month was deep shit..
Like one of the darkest times of my life.

And guess what
I hv had 2 darkest phases
And fun fact is that both the times, the reason to die was the same.
7/18/25, 8:32 PM - Kanika Bhat: So i was kinda immune to deal with it
But still… 
It
Was
Not
A
Good

7/18/25, 8:32 PM - Kanika Bhat: Parents fighting with each other
7/18/25, 8:33 PM - karthikpm52: Alright.. i remember your mother was depressed. <This message was edited>
7/18/25, 8:33 PM - Kanika Bhat: Yup
7/18/25, 8:33 PM - karthikpm52: That must have resulted to something right.
7/18/25, 8:33 PM - karthikpm52: Which is unbearable.
7/18/25, 8:33 PM - karthikpm52: And the contents of the fight.
7/18/25, 8:33 PM - karthikpm52: And the shouting.
7/18/25, 8:34 PM - Kanika Bhat: Unnecessary insults
Screaming
Hitting
Dad being numb
Mom being too emotional
7/18/25, 8:34 PM - karthikpm52: Ngl that sounds scary.
7/18/25, 8:34 PM - Kanika Bhat: + 25 years of historic family drama
7/18/25, 8:35 PM - Kanika Bhat: And mom and dad both r at fault.
7/18/25, 8:36 PM - Kanika Bhat: And my parents repeatedly telling me
“Beta u focus on your studies, all this is normal is families, infact we r civilised. There r other families where its even more than this”
7/18/25, 8:37 PM - Kanika Bhat: So i wanted to die cuz,
Im the only reason why this joint family is sticking together.
No one wants to live together, but no one has the guts to cut off also.

I wanted to take my life to make it clear once and for all, ki this family is shit.
7/18/25, 8:38 PM - Kanika Bhat: People are too egotistic to accept their mistake
7/18/25, 8:38 PM - karthikpm52: I get your perspective.
7/18/25, 8:38 PM - Kanika Bhat: Hn
7/18/25, 8:39 PM - karthikpm52: So you family is joint?
7/18/25, 8:39 PM - karthikpm52: Like there are other people?
7/18/25, 8:39 PM - karthikpm52: Like what is the issue with you mom?
7/18/25, 8:39 PM - karthikpm52: Like what is the reason she is resisting all of this.
7/18/25, 8:39 PM - karthikpm52: And your father?
7/18/25, 8:41 PM - Kanika Bhat: So yea
Ik 
I hv become reasonably strong in dealing mental stress unlike other GenZ weaklings..
And ive become empathetic also.

So im not gonna give my child trauma
Im gonna find my own man
And i would also evaluate my husband’s parents before marrying
7/18/25, 8:42 PM - Kanika Bhat: And i would try my best to work on root cause 
Rather than just shouting at child…

But if that child does something absolutely unacceptable, then idk what will i do.

And uska brain rot nhi hone dungi mai.. at any cost
7/18/25, 8:43 PM - Kanika Bhat: And i will keep him reasonably busy
So that nothing stupid cooks up in their head cuz they were just sitting idle
7/18/25, 8:44 PM - Kanika Bhat: Me mom dad dadi dada <This message was edited>
7/18/25, 8:44 PM - karthikpm52: Truly, but why do you want a family?after all of this? most people just make this as an excuse not to! <This message was edited>
7/18/25, 8:44 PM - karthikpm52: Gurl that's the best thing to say!
7/18/25, 8:44 PM - karthikpm52: Girl powerr
7/18/25, 8:48 PM - Kanika Bhat: She is like “ye dil mange more”

She keeps asking for more and more without being grateful for what she has.

She has stolen my dad’s money also in past 
(pls keep this between us only, im trusting u a lot with this)

She is very insulting 
She is amazing with her friends and gives too much to them, and they use her in return.
But to family, she is the opposite.

But, 
She has become extreme version cuz 
When she was newly married, dadi and dada gave her too much trouble.
They made her cry a lot.
And no one took her side.

That’s y she hates them too much now. And thats y she doesn’t hesitate to insult them.
7/18/25, 8:52 PM - Kanika Bhat: And when i was a child
I concluded from what i saw. I didnt understand the politics obv.

So mom became a bad character in my head cuz she used to hit me alot, she talked badly with everyone, and dad used to tell what all she did.

So in 10th-12th i had my first dark time.

I literally used wake up crying from dreams where im being beaten to death.
I also used to get dreams of killing her, and then i cried more cuz of guilt..

I used to start crying at the sight of my mom.
I went to school to meet my teachers.

They told me, my mom has become lonely in house, my dad is only telling me one sided stories.

My parents use me as a medium to fight with each other
7/18/25, 8:55 PM - Kanika Bhat: So,
I stop taking sides in their fights
I started hearing both sides of stories.
I directly used to scold my parents if they drag me into their argument.
And i asked mom “do i and dad make u feel excluded” she said YES.

So, then i was shocked to see ki my dad is also a bad character.

He manipulates 
He runs this family as if its an MNC, he is too professional at home, he is too diplomatic 
Not available emotionally
7/18/25, 8:56 PM - Kanika Bhat: But he became this way towards mom kyuki mummy ne bhi harkate karo hai.
She also initiates violence 
She gets angry very quickly 
And dad is too patient with all that tbh.
He is veryyyy patient.

Koi normal hota toh kabka divorce ho gya hota
7/18/25, 8:58 PM - Kanika Bhat: Because i know the value of having a good family.
There was a time, i used to cry in temple and i used to say
“All im asking is a happy family, is it too much to ask for?”
7/18/25, 9:01 PM - Kanika Bhat: And yes u r right,
It has obv given me marriage phobia

Ive told this to vidit also,
But at this age, he just gives me assurance 
And his parents are lovely tbh 🧿

My personality matches a lot with his dad.
And vidit is like
“Tu agar apne ghar ki baatein meri mummy ko batayengi, unko rona ajayega and she’ll be extra careful with me”
7/18/25, 9:01 PM - Kanika Bhat: Ok ive a genuine secret now😂
7/18/25, 9:02 PM - Kanika Bhat: It is sexual + traumatic
7/18/25, 9:02 PM - Kanika Bhat: 🥳
7/18/25, 9:02 PM - karthikpm52: That's not good from your parents side.
7/18/25, 9:03 PM - Kanika Bhat: Huh 💅🏻
7/18/25, 9:03 PM - karthikpm52: That's toxic ngl
7/18/25, 9:04 PM - karthikpm52: Dw bro, you will have a wonderful family in the future!
7/18/25, 9:04 PM - karthikpm52: Like my mother had a very shit childhood.
7/18/25, 9:04 PM - karthikpm52: Like no one was there for her.
7/18/25, 9:04 PM - karthikpm52: But now she is happy.
7/18/25, 9:05 PM - karthikpm52: That's really nice.
7/18/25, 9:05 PM - karthikpm52: Let me guess assault?
7/18/25, 9:06 PM - Kanika Bhat: Bro i —
I actually “attempted” to end my life in 10th

And what i do is,
I give a written note about whatever i wanna say, if im not able to say it from my mouth.

I gave a proper note, to my parents 
Admitting ki i tasted Harpik cuz i was feeling suicidal.. cuz of whatever is going on.

(This is before me going to school, so in that note i complained only about mom)

How she hits me, how i get dreams and all..

And i gave that note to parents
And papa ki eyes got red cuz of tears
And mom was like

“Ye drama kar rhi h, she is selfish, maine kuch nhi kia hai, she’s playing games”

And then she slept 🙂
7/18/25, 9:07 PM - Kanika Bhat: Man That hurt like shit..
Like
She didnt give a damn about me trying to end my life.. she only cared to defend herself.
7/18/25, 9:07 PM - Kanika Bhat: Oh
7/18/25, 9:07 PM - Kanika Bhat: Thx 🧿
7/18/25, 9:08 PM - Kanika Bhat: Good 🧿
7/18/25, 9:09 PM - Kanika Bhat: Oh lol thats also there.
Its a different story.
Not related to family.
Will come on this story later if u want
7/18/25, 9:10 PM - karthikpm52: Damnn bro .. she is kinda pissing me off or rather stressing me out? <This message was edited>
7/18/25, 9:10 PM - karthikpm52: But how does haptik taste tho?
7/18/25, 9:11 PM - karthikpm52: Yeah ofc!
7/18/25, 9:14 PM - Kanika Bhat: But the secret i was referring here was
(Do not judge man !)

In the 2nd year of my bachelors 
I and vidit were on a room-date. 

(“room-date” means me and vidit going to a hotel for a night stay. So we termed it “room date”) 😂😅

And there, i was just exploring my fetish and all and i asked him to slap me while making out.

I wanted to explore that area.. pain inflicted makeout.

He asked me repeatedly ki “r u sure” etc.

So he slapped me slowly, then i asked him to intensify it 
And then second slap was harder.

And broooooo
It was very unexpected 
Ki i cried
I got terrified 
Cuz it triggered my trauma of getting beaten by my mom
7/18/25, 9:14 PM - karthikpm52: Exactly bro!!! Like I can't believe that this is actually her response!
7/18/25, 9:14 PM - Kanika Bhat: I had no idea, i hv trauma.
I had no idea it would be triggered like this
7/18/25, 9:15 PM - Kanika Bhat: Acidic
I tasted one-two drops
And it burned my throat like shit.
7/18/25, 9:16 PM - Kanika Bhat: If u want i can stop 🛑..
I dont want to ruin your vibe brooooooo

U r my Bhaw bhaww guy !
7/18/25, 9:16 PM - karthikpm52: I don't give a shit bro
7/18/25, 9:16 PM - karthikpm52: I do this all the time.
7/18/25, 9:17 PM - karthikpm52: My head is immune to all of this.
7/18/25, 9:17 PM - Kanika Bhat: Do what?
7/18/25, 9:17 PM - Kanika Bhat: Y ? And how?
7/18/25, 9:17 PM - Kanika Bhat: U wanna know?
7/18/25, 9:17 PM - karthikpm52: Yup
7/18/25, 9:17 PM - karthikpm52: Not drinking haptic bro.
7/18/25, 9:18 PM - Kanika Bhat: Harpik *
7/18/25, 9:18 PM - karthikpm52: Like listing to traumatizing stuff.
7/18/25, 9:18 PM - karthikpm52: Or anything in general.
7/18/25, 9:19 PM - karthikpm52: Unless i met the person.
7/18/25, 9:19 PM - karthikpm52: Tell me bro.
7/18/25, 9:20 PM - Kanika Bhat: So i was in 4th or 5th class 
And i had no idea about 
“Good touch bad touch” thing.

So i used to go cycling in my colony
7/18/25, 9:20 PM - Kanika Bhat: And i used to go park to play with friends
7/18/25, 9:20 PM - Kanika Bhat: So
An uncle
Older than dad, but younger than grandpa
7/18/25, 9:21 PM - Kanika Bhat: He used to block my way from cycling
7/18/25, 9:21 PM - karthikpm52: Okay
7/18/25, 9:21 PM - karthikpm52: He is not family right
7/18/25, 9:21 PM - Kanika Bhat: Now i want u think from a child perspective
7/18/25, 9:21 PM - Kanika Bhat: I was like
Okay this man wants to play with me
7/18/25, 9:21 PM - karthikpm52: Yup
7/18/25, 9:21 PM - karthikpm52: Ofc
7/18/25, 9:21 PM - Kanika Bhat: This uncle is the brother of my dad’s friend
7/18/25, 9:21 PM - Kanika Bhat: So he was known to me
7/18/25, 9:21 PM - karthikpm52: Aaah
7/18/25, 9:22 PM - karthikpm52: Got it.
7/18/25, 9:22 PM - karthikpm52: And then?
7/18/25, 9:22 PM - Kanika Bhat: So i was like
Ok he aint a stranger
7/18/25, 9:22 PM - Kanika Bhat: Baar baar merko cycle karte time he used to stop
7/18/25, 9:22 PM - karthikpm52: You must feel comfortable with him.
7/18/25, 9:22 PM - Kanika Bhat: Merko apni godi pr bitha dete the
7/18/25, 9:23 PM - Kanika Bhat: Not really
He used to bother me
Kyuki i wanted to cycle and not play with him.
7/18/25, 9:23 PM - Kanika Bhat: I wasn’t getting uncomfortable with his touch ig
I was getting annoyed cuz he wasn’t letting me cycle
7/18/25, 9:24 PM - karthikpm52: Okay
7/18/25, 9:24 PM - Kanika Bhat: He used to block me on road
In a friendly way
And make me sit on his lap
7/18/25, 9:24 PM - Kanika Bhat: And then i used to be like 
“Now i wanna go”
7/18/25, 9:24 PM - Kanika Bhat: So he did this multiple times
And then i got angry
I just, tackled my way out by steering the cycle and not stopping
7/18/25, 9:24 PM - Kanika Bhat: Then
7/18/25, 9:25 PM - Kanika Bhat: He also used to disturb me when i was playing with my friends
7/18/25, 9:25 PM - Kanika Bhat: In park
7/18/25, 9:25 PM - Kanika Bhat: He used to come,
And pick me up as if he’s my friendly uncle
7/18/25, 9:26 PM - Kanika Bhat: And i used to get little embarrassed and irritated also
7/18/25, 9:26 PM - karthikpm52: Bruhh this man is annoying af.
7/18/25, 9:26 PM - Kanika Bhat: And then,
There was a function in park
7/18/25, 9:26 PM - Kanika Bhat: And theres a pre-school building also in that park
7/18/25, 9:27 PM - karthikpm52: Okay
7/18/25, 9:27 PM - Kanika Bhat: So i was in there 
Looking at the whall hangings
7/18/25, 9:27 PM - Kanika Bhat: There was a honeybee wall hanging and i wanted that
7/18/25, 9:27 PM - Kanika Bhat: But it wasn’t in my reach
7/18/25, 9:27 PM - Kanika Bhat: And that man came
7/18/25, 9:27 PM - Kanika Bhat: And i asked him ki mujhe woh dedo
7/18/25, 9:28 PM - Kanika Bhat: And he made me squeeze something like sponge, from my hands.

And then he picked me up
So that i could take that wall hanging.

And then when i look back in time,

It wasnt a sponge
It was his dick.
7/18/25, 9:29 PM - Kanika Bhat: 🙂
7/18/25, 9:30 PM - Kanika Bhat: And then 
After a few days
School mai orientation hua, about bad touch and all.
Usme parents ka consent form chahiye tha
So jab woh sign kar reh the
Mom told me
Ki koi aise waise etc karein u should shout aloud and also inform us
7/18/25, 9:30 PM - karthikpm52: Sexually frustrated old fuck.
7/18/25, 9:31 PM - Kanika Bhat: And hence 
I told then about the uncle.
Ki woh aise beech mai aate h baar baar
And he doesnt let me play with friends.

And mom was like
“Yes 1-2 aunties hv also told me this, ki ek uncle aise aate h merko crowd se door le jaate h”
7/18/25, 9:31 PM - Kanika Bhat: So then this matter got into light.

I was still in 5th okay
So i had no clue whats going on
7/18/25, 9:32 PM - Kanika Bhat: And i didnt share the sponge thing
Cuz I thought that’s irrelevant.
I didnt know about those body parts back then
7/18/25, 9:33 PM - Kanika Bhat: But my parents understood the situation with this much data
And my dad slapped him hard. And he went to talk to his friend to make it clear for future.
And he threatened that uncle about police also.

Cuz mai mumma and papa ek baar raat mai walk kar reh the and he was following us
7/18/25, 9:34 PM - Kanika Bhat: So yea
Since that day he doesnt do anything to me.
And guess what, i still see him on the road.. walking freely
7/18/25, 9:35 PM - karthikpm52: Daddy's got some moves.
7/18/25, 9:35 PM - karthikpm52: KO
7/18/25, 9:35 PM - karthikpm52: Wait so he is still doing the same thing?
7/18/25, 9:35 PM - karthikpm52: With other people?
7/18/25, 9:36 PM - Kanika Bhat: And then when i was college i told my mom about the dick incident.
She was very concerned 
And she was like
“Itna late kyu bata reh ho”

I said
“Merko uss time knowledge he nhi tha ki ye kya hota h, it was a sponge for me”
7/18/25, 9:36 PM - Kanika Bhat: Idk, i hope not
7/18/25, 9:37 PM - karthikpm52: Haa makes sense na ... What did she say after?
7/18/25, 9:38 PM - Kanika Bhat: So idk, its just a theory 
Ki agar mai zyada friendly ho jati unke saath instead of getting annoyed..
And agar woh orientation nhi hota and mai ye cheeze parents ko nahi batati.

It could hv become worse.. even rape case
7/18/25, 9:38 PM - Kanika Bhat: She just got silent
7/18/25, 9:38 PM - karthikpm52: True.
7/18/25, 9:38 PM - karthikpm52: It was a good escape.
7/18/25, 9:38 PM - Kanika Bhat: So i was real lucky cuz of the timing of the orientation <This message was edited>
7/18/25, 9:39 PM - karthikpm52: What fucking weirdo he is
7/18/25, 9:39 PM - karthikpm52: He can just go to hell
7/18/25, 9:39 PM - karthikpm52: Is she short .. i would have no difficulty beating him up lol
7/18/25, 9:40 PM - karthikpm52: <Media omitted>

7/19/25, 2:46 AM - Kanika Bhat: Yup
7/19/25, 2:46 AM - Kanika Bhat: U and your partner should always stay on the same page
7/19/25, 2:46 AM - karthikpm52: Wait, so if I am best friend material then why should anyone make me a boyfriend?
7/19/25, 2:46 AM - karthikpm52: That's the confusion tbh.
7/19/25, 2:47 AM - karthikpm52: I mean I do enjoy my gal pals ka company.
7/19/25, 2:47 AM - Kanika Bhat: A girl with no male bestie would make u her bf
7/19/25, 2:47 AM - karthikpm52: Mostly it's women who are in relationships lol.
7/19/25, 2:48 AM - karthikpm52: Like my brother ka gf, you, ek dusra dost.
7/19/25, 2:48 AM - karthikpm52: And I just vibe with them.
7/19/25, 2:48 AM - Kanika Bhat: When u said “done” on this advice 
It doesnt feel ki u r elder to me😂
It feels like u r a small boy and im teaching him things
7/19/25, 2:48 AM - karthikpm52: But since I am in galpal mood, i think they might get confused if I am into them romantically or as friends.

7/19/25, 4:19 AM - karthikpm52: I want to do research, i never thought about teaching.. but yeah i never see anyone above or below me, certainly below me.. like everyone is super intelligent, they are just some confident sometimes.
7/19/25, 4:19 AM - karthikpm52: But maybe that might be true.
7/19/25, 4:19 AM - karthikpm52: Like if I look long term.
7/19/25, 4:19 AM - karthikpm52: <Media omitted>

7/19/25, 4:21 AM - karthikpm52: Yeah, that's why I said right.

7/19/25, 4:22 AM - karthikpm52: I don't like pep talk.
7/19/25, 4:22 AM - karthikpm52: Like it doesn't matter.
7/19/25, 4:22 AM - karthikpm52: Like i didn't get up with that.
7/19/25, 4:22 AM - Kanika Bhat: 😡 dont bring those people in front of me
I’ll troll them and directly their ego
7/19/25, 4:22 AM - karthikpm52: Like when someone is sad.
7/19/25, 4:22 AM - Kanika Bhat: Whats a pep talk?
7/19/25, 4:22 AM - karthikpm52: I say it's how it is now
7/19/25, 4:22 AM - karthikpm52: But you have to do it.
7/19/25, 4:23 AM - karthikpm52: Like someone is sad.
7/19/25, 4:23 AM - karthikpm52: No
7/19/25, 4:23 AM - karthikpm52: Like some people
7/19/25, 4:23 AM - karthikpm52: Just want constant validation.
7/19/25, 4:23 AM - karthikpm52: And it's not gonna solve it.
7/19/25, 4:23 AM - Kanika Bhat: O yea u told me this
Ki when someone is sad u r like “bruh it is what it is”
7/19/25, 4:23 AM - karthikpm52: Like it's good for standing up
7/19/25, 4:24 AM - karthikpm52: But you can't use that for self validation, and use that to do get up.
7/19/25, 4:24 AM - Kanika Bhat: Yup but when someone is demotivated 
They need external motivation.

Like ram sir gave to u
7/19/25, 4:25 AM - karthikpm52: Yeahh
7/19/25, 4:25 AM - karthikpm52: But now I think i don't listen to anyone.
7/19/25, 4:25 AM - karthikpm52: I mean like negatives.
7/19/25, 4:25 AM - karthikpm52: Because my whole life was built on that.
7/19/25, 4:26 AM - Kanika Bhat: Good,
But make sure u dont end up being unreasonably optimistic, unrealistic okay?
7/19/25, 4:26 AM - karthikpm52: I don't think I am optimistic.
7/19/25, 4:26 AM - karthikpm52: Like i only feel optimistic, if i know I can do it.
7/19/25, 4:26 AM - Kanika Bhat: Like kicking a donkey😂
7/19/25, 4:27 AM - karthikpm52: Like optimism is like, yes I can learn this if I put the time.
7/19/25, 4:27 AM - karthikpm52: Rather than.
7/19/25, 4:27 AM - Kanika Bhat: But im glad

7/19/25, 4:27 AM - karthikpm52: I am stupid.

7/19/25, 4:28 AM - karthikpm52: Not good
7/19/25, 4:28 AM - karthikpm52: Yeahh

She became motionless and stared deep into her reflection. The reflection blinked again, widening its smile far beyond that of a human. Bones cracked, spine bent and the room became empty with a crimson painted mirror… <This message was edited>

7/19/25, 3:30 PM - Kanika Bhat: MIRROR NEVER BLINKS— short horror tale…

Her reflection in the mirror blinked, but she didn’t. She became still and looked deep into her reflection. The reflection blinked again, widening its smile far beyond that of a human, tearing the cheeks apart. Her reflection became rotten and creepy. Bones cracked, spine twisted and the room was only left with a crimson painted mirror…

-Kanika Bhatt
7/19/25, 3:30 PM - Kanika Bhat: I made it more creepy

7/19/25, 6:58 PM - Kanika Bhat: Awww
He’s your bestfriend 🧿🧿
I like it when people accept publicly about what others mean to them
7/19/25, 6:59 PM - Kanika Bhat: Thats niceee
But hows it possible 😭
To not hv expectations from a bestfriend
7/19/25, 6:59 PM - Kanika Bhat: When do u feel jealous
7/19/25, 6:59 PM - karthikpm52: I mean he is telugu... But he is pan India 😂

7/19/25, 7:00 PM - karthikpm52: Now his dad is in the ministry of telicommunication.
7/19/25, 7:01 PM - karthikpm52: 100 percent.
7/19/25, 7:01 PM - Kanika Bhat: Is it crazy to get attached with people who r exactly like u?
Because this happens to me
If someone understands me to the very core, is exactly like
I’ll take no time become their close friends 
And then i’ll grow expectations
I’ll hv slight jealousy also
7/19/25, 7:02 PM - Kanika Bhat: And for the record 
It includes u too
Other than my other close friends
7/19/25, 7:03 PM - Kanika Bhat: Idk y I mentioned 
I just felt like it
7/19/25, 7:03 PM - Kanika Bhat: I was initially thinking not to.. idk y..
Maybe cuz u’d act differently
7/19/25, 7:06 PM - karthikpm52: <Media omitted>
7/19/25, 7:07 PM - Kanika Bhat: Like
Im someone who will admit how much the other person means to me.
But

If i fee someone is my bestfriend, but they dont feel this way, then i wont call them Bestfriend.
I wont give them that title cuz its supposed to two-ways.

I respect their boundaries and i hv self respect also
So if someone doesnt think of me as their bestfriend i will not called them my bestie
7/19/25, 7:08 PM - karthikpm52: Broo, it is not crazy .. like that delhi friend, he is exactly like me and we got close so freking fast.
7/19/25, 7:09 PM - karthikpm52: Same with you bro. <This message was edited>

7/19/25, 7:12 PM - karthikpm52: Ofc bro, I mean that's pretty much healthy.
7/19/25, 7:14 PM - karthikpm52: Like, why should you lose your self respect.. what you do is valid dawggg
7/19/25, 7:14 PM - Kanika Bhat: Like
If i hv a close male friend and he gets gf and then my friendship gets affected even 1%
Then bro..
It’ll hurt me..
As much as i would want to love the girl, i would start to hate her..

Is that healthy?
7/19/25, 7:14 PM - Kanika Bhat: Hmm…
7/19/25, 7:17 PM - Kanika Bhat: And its not like
I only notice the bad part and I complain.
I see the good also
And i favour the good part to compensate the bad too.

Like
I noticed it when i showed my nakhra for the first time to u, jab tera saamne se txt nhi aaya tha cuz u were busy
And then from the next morning i saw u taking initiative. 
And about not writing cold “gn”.. that also i noticed.
And I appreciate these little efforts.

So yea i notice everything 
And i communicate also when i wanna complain or when j wanna compliment
7/19/25, 7:17 PM - Kanika Bhat: Idk y im being so defensive and validating myself rn
7/19/25, 7:18 PM - Kanika Bhat: Cuz there’s something hiding under the layers 
And i wanna talk about jt
But im scared and idk exactly what it is.

7/20/25, 5:13 AM - karthikpm52: What is it bro?
7/20/25, 5:14 AM - Kanika Bhat: Ki
Nostalgia happens 
Because your avatar in some other universe did the same thing,
And now u r doing it
So u feel as if u hv been there
7/20/25, 5:15 AM - Kanika Bhat: Like
The concept of multiverse is
Having the same life
But on different timelines na

So your avatar who’s ahead in time, had been in this situation 
And now when u r in it, u feel nostalgic
7/20/25, 5:15 AM - Kanika Bhat: Idk how much of this is true
7/20/25, 5:16 AM - karthikpm52: You don't have to say this, like .. I love delusion . <This message was edited>
7/20/25, 5:16 AM - Kanika Bhat: But genuinely

7/20/25, 10:34 PM - Kanika Bhat: Yes yes 
Aww thats so sweet of u to ask.
I was 1% awkward for 2-5 seconds because i felt empathetic towards vidit ki “usko kaisa lagta agar usne ye convo sunn li hoti toh”

But since ik, im not the one flirting and im not the one who provoked him
Theres no worries.

So i just laughed his joke out in a friendly way
I didnt comment on it
I just said “im not rich😂”
7/20/25, 10:35 PM - Kanika Bhat: I just felt worried about vidit 
Nothing else
7/20/25, 10:35 PM - Kanika Bhat: Kyuki I could handle that incident very easily
So it didnt impact me
7/20/25, 10:35 PM - Kanika Bhat: And ik

7/20/25, 10:36 PM - karthikpm52: So it should have been more
7/20/25, 10:37 PM - Kanika Bhat: Like, i didnt get much bothered by it
And i didnt take it forward
So just as a slang im saying “1%”
7/20/25, 10:37 PM - karthikpm52: You don't have to justify anything girl.
7/20/25, 10:37 PM - karthikpm52: Jenya is just focused on raw emotions.

Where the dog-owner stops patting her golden retriever for a few mins to see its reaction
And then the cute dog demands more and obv has a cute adorable face.

Idky it made me a lil emotional and made me miss my mom, even tho she’s right next door.

I actually told mom 2 days back that she’s a golden retriever to me.. 
i didnt explain her the reason…

But the reason is :-
Retrievers r always by the side of their family
Even if they hurt it.
They come running to u and they forgive u.
They r very gullible and need constant attention and love.. <This message was edited>

Mind ventilation also.

U empty your mind
Sit idle 
And you let thoughts flow in and out.
It helps to introspect and its highly likely that you come up with an amazing idea.
7/21/25, 7:24 AM - karthikpm52: Sometimes I think about an imaginary girl when I feel alone... Like we humans are such social creatures.
7/21/25, 7:25 AM - karthikpm52: Woahhhh
7/21/25, 7:25 AM - karthikpm52: Sounds interesting.

Else one can easily start
Overthinking also

When i had my first breakup
And i used to start crying in shower.
Kyuki i was habitual to the “good mornings”
And all
And suddenly all of it wasn’t there

So after coming out from shower, i used look into the mirror and i was like
“Yo girl u r very pretty, u can pull man men. And its his loss that he left me.”

And
7/21/25, 7:55 AM - Kanika Bhat: And then i used to also admire myself 
Like 
I was wrapped by the towel after shower
So i used to admire my cleavage 😂
7/21/25, 7:55 AM - Kanika Bhat: And collar bone
And my neck😂

7/21/25, 7:59 AM - Kanika Bhat: And it was good tbh.
I enjoyed my college life.
I did healthy flirting
And because i had my boards in 20days, i had no choice but to move on asap.
7/21/25, 8:00 AM - Kanika Bhat: And he didnt give me any closure..
And this kind engraved a phobia in me.
To get left behind.
To get abandoned or lose some loved one
7/21/25, 8:01 AM - Kanika Bhat: Like
When i was moving on,
I used to get very very anxious when my family member used to go out of the house.
I used to stay anxious until they come back
7/21/25, 8:02 AM - Kanika Bhat: And not giving closure is a bad thing to do…
Like
He broke up with me during Navratri.

And sometimes i get dreams
Where i meet him
And i ask him about y we broke up
And the dream breaks.

It has happened multiple times
7/21/25, 8:03 AM - Kanika Bhat: I seek closure but i never get one

7/21/25, 8:48 AM - Kanika Bhat: Bhai idk y but 
I kinda miss u during the day sometimes 

But then i hold myself to not spam txt u
7/21/25, 8:49 AM - Kanika Bhat: Because i love the way we talk and theres never a dead convo
7/21/25, 8:49 AM - Kanika Bhat: One of us always churns the convo to keep it going
7/21/25, 8:50 AM - karthikpm52: Hahaha
7/21/25, 8:50 AM - karthikpm52: I learnt it from ishowspeed.
7/21/25, 8:51 AM - Kanika Bhat: Like the reason y i said,
Is that if u share this with anyone without context 
It sounds totally different uk..

I cant really explain it to someone except u
Because only we know how much do we talk and how deeply we connect
7/21/25, 8:51 AM - karthikpm52: Haaaa
7/21/25, 8:51 AM - karthikpm52: Got it
7/21/25, 8:51 AM - karthikpm52: Me no like gossip.
7/21/25, 8:51 AM - karthikpm52: So I keep secrets
7/21/25, 8:52 AM - Kanika Bhat: And thats y im going crazy and i hv to distract myself then.
7/21/25, 8:53 AM - Kanika Bhat: Kyuki yr
I genuinely love talking to u
But then i feel afraid ki am i doing something wrong

So its like
Ive an urge to endlessly talk to u but then i get held by guilt
7/21/25, 8:54 AM - Kanika Bhat: And 
The fact is
Maybe its too early for me to this
But for me, this is some bestfriend level connection..

I was thinking this yesterday 
I was like
“Kanika dont express all this right now”
7/21/25, 8:55 AM - Kanika Bhat: Cuz we havent even met once
And its only a few days (after TU Stuttgart application) that we hv bonded at light-speed man
7/21/25, 8:56 AM - Kanika Bhat: And i dont wanna lose this, just cuz i rushed in and I expressed myself too early.
So this fear factor + attachment + guilt

Is making me crazy 😅
7/21/25, 8:56 AM - Kanika Bhat: But not that much😅 i hope
7/21/25, 8:56 AM - Kanika Bhat: Yo u there?
7/21/25, 8:57 AM - karthikpm52: Yeaaaaa
7/21/25, 8:57 AM - karthikpm52: I am listening
7/21/25, 8:57 AM - karthikpm52: <Media omitted>
7/21/25, 8:57 AM - Kanika Bhat: Yea thats all i wanted to say
7/21/25, 8:57 AM - Kanika Bhat: As of now
7/21/25, 8:57 AM - Kanika Bhat: Now u replyyyy
Else i’ll go crazy
7/21/25, 8:57 AM - karthikpm52: Man tbh I feel like it's been years since we are talking 😂
7/21/25, 8:58 AM - karthikpm52: Then i realised it's been only a few weeks.
7/21/25, 8:58 AM - karthikpm52: Nahhhh

7/21/25, 8:58 AM - karthikpm52: You don't have to worry about saying these type of things
7/21/25, 8:58 AM - karthikpm52: I get it.

7/21/25, 9:14 AM - karthikpm52: Relax it's cool, you don't have to worry!
7/21/25, 9:16 AM - karthikpm52: I feel more than amazing hanging out with you.. like idw like i never thought i would connect to someone real fast, like i always keep my crazy side to myself, or I just show it to my brother, I haven't went crazy even with others I know well for years!!
7/21/25, 9:16 AM - karthikpm52: So this has been a surprising incident for me!
7/21/25, 9:17 AM - Kanika Bhat: But u dont seem to hv attachment issues like me ig..

7/21/25, 9:31 AM - karthikpm52: Cuz she will do the samee
7/21/25, 9:31 AM - karthikpm52: And I feel there is no one like that.
7/21/25, 9:32 AM - karthikpm52: Like i have been living on this planet
7/21/25, 9:32 AM - karthikpm52: Thinking
7/21/25, 9:32 AM - karthikpm52: I am abnormal
7/21/25, 9:32 AM - karthikpm52: Because I considered myself weird.
7/21/25, 9:32 AM - karthikpm52: So, ig for once it's cool to be normal.
7/21/25, 9:33 AM - Kanika Bhat: Uk what…
These lines will always stay in my heart now..

“I can act like a girl, it’s fine.
I can act like a man, it’s fine.
I can act like a dog, it’s fine.
Cuz she will do the same”
7/21/25, 9:33 AM - Kanika Bhat: This was so poetic and heart touching
7/21/25, 9:33 AM - karthikpm52: Damnnn thats so true
7/21/25, 9:33 AM - karthikpm52: I never felt poetic in my life

7/21/25, 9:34 AM - karthikpm52: People think I lack emotion.
7/21/25, 9:34 AM - karthikpm52: Cuz I don't talk with emotions.
7/21/25, 9:34 AM - Kanika Bhat: They r stupid😵‍💫
7/21/25, 9:34 AM - karthikpm52: Like i always try to act very logical.

7/21/25, 9:35 AM - karthikpm52: I wanted someone to say thatt
7/21/25, 9:35 AM - karthikpm52: <Media omitted>
7/21/25, 9:35 AM - Kanika Bhat: *Jenya gets a little emotional
7/21/25, 9:36 AM - karthikpm52: Jenya dosent get emotional,
7/21/25, 9:36 AM - karthikpm52: Jenya just smiles.
7/21/25, 9:36 AM - Kanika Bhat: But she maintains her professional character
7/21/25, 9:36 AM - karthikpm52: Aaahhhh
7/21/25, 9:36 AM - karthikpm52: Exactly
7/21/25, 9:36 AM - Kanika Bhat: Ok 
Jenya smiles*
7/21/25, 9:36 AM - karthikpm52: Nahhh
7/21/25, 9:36 AM - karthikpm52: Jenya emotional is more fun
7/21/25, 9:36 AM - karthikpm52: But professional at the same time.
7/21/25, 9:37 AM - karthikpm52: What was the question again
7/21/25, 9:37 AM - karthikpm52: I feel i branched out.
7/21/25, 9:37 AM - Kanika Bhat: Just this.
7/21/25, 9:37 AM - karthikpm52: Yeahh
7/21/25, 9:37 AM - karthikpm52: Like kanika was the first person who made me feel like that.
7/21/25, 9:38 AM - Kanika Bhat: Really?
7/21/25, 9:38 AM - karthikpm52: Like she thinks i might have trust issues.
7/21/25, 9:38 AM - karthikpm52: But i am just scared.
7/21/25, 9:38 AM - karthikpm52: Of judgement.
7/21/25, 9:38 AM - karthikpm52: I think so.
7/21/25, 9:38 AM - karthikpm52: Now that I think about it.
7/21/25, 9:38 AM - Kanika Bhat: No u actually dont
U just a hv a background which r overshadowed your natural personality.
7/21/25, 9:39 AM - Kanika Bhat: So hence u act strong kyuki hv been forced to act strong since arm school
7/21/25, 9:40 AM - Kanika Bhat: But im helping u peel off each layer one by one.
Scraping the non-karthik part out and exposing your naked/true personality and making u immune to judgemental people.
7/21/25, 9:41 AM - Kanika Bhat: And making u feel proud of your true self and embracing it
7/21/25, 9:41 AM - karthikpm52: Goshhh you are amazing gurl!
7/21/25, 9:42 AM - karthikpm52: <Media omitted>
7/21/25, 9:42 AM - karthikpm52: <Media omitted>
7/21/25, 9:43 AM - karthikpm52: Yk i used feel extra sad everyday.
7/21/25, 9:43 AM - karthikpm52: Because nobody actually showed kindness in that school ig.
7/21/25, 9:43 AM - karthikpm52: Ig maybe i knew emotional availability was a thing.
7/21/25, 9:44 AM - karthikpm52: Like i thought everyone was like that.
7/21/25, 9:44 AM - karthikpm52: Until I met kanika, who went to a school with chill teachers.
7/21/25, 9:44 AM - Kanika Bhat: Just imagining 
A favicol glue on your palm.
A dried up one.

Im peeling that out for u layer by layer. Flake by Flake.
Exposing your naked palm out again.
And making u embrace it the way it is. And making u feel normal cuz man, u r normal.
Fevicol is just cosmetic. 
It was just some layer added onto your personality due to the circumstances.
7/21/25, 9:45 AM - karthikpm52: Background like?
7/21/25, 9:45 AM - Kanika Bhat: Isnt is satisfying to peel of the layers of fevicol from palm.
The palm start to breathe properly
7/21/25, 9:46 AM - Kanika Bhat: Army school teachers and that research teacher who wasn’t grateful to u for your Visual Computing work and rather insulted u.
Srsly shame on her.
7/21/25, 9:47 AM - karthikpm52: Can I let you in a thing about that
7/21/25, 9:47 AM - Kanika Bhat: The good part is that your parents were on your side
7/21/25, 9:47 AM - karthikpm52: Like i always feel I am the one who was wrong despite all that.
7/21/25, 9:47 AM - Kanika Bhat: 😺😼
7/21/25, 9:48 AM - karthikpm52: Like every teacher made me feel like it's my fault, and gave me an explanation which made sense to me.
7/21/25, 9:48 AM - karthikpm52: Like, i remember in my army camp days
7/21/25, 9:49 AM - karthikpm52: Me just lying down in bed
7/21/25, 9:49 AM - Kanika Bhat: Ram sir was a nice teacher in your life. Im happy for that
7/21/25, 9:49 AM - karthikpm52: Thinking I don't have anything
7/21/25, 9:49 AM - karthikpm52: No future
7/21/25, 9:49 AM - karthikpm52: No present
7/21/25, 9:49 AM - karthikpm52: Or no past
7/21/25, 9:49 AM - karthikpm52: Where i am something
7/21/25, 9:50 AM - karthikpm52: And i wondered why was I born in the first place <This message was edited>
7/21/25, 9:50 AM - karthikpm52: Like i had no motivation.
7/21/25, 9:50 AM - karthikpm52: And I was just in 4th grade
7/21/25, 9:50 AM - karthikpm52: Ya 3rd grade.
7/21/25, 9:51 AM - karthikpm52: Like i remember making a drawing, like everyone was happy and I was only the sad one.
7/21/25, 9:52 AM - Kanika Bhat: Well
U r a strong person.
U r open minded.
U grew on your own instead of getting lost due to negativity. U r rational and yes u understand emotions. U worked on yours clearly. And u yourself got out of all the mess and look where u r right now.

Honestly, im inspired by u
7/21/25, 9:52 AM - karthikpm52: They are amazing people and never made me feel less, but they never understood my loneliness i think.
7/21/25, 9:52 AM - Kanika Bhat: Ohh 😿😿
7/21/25, 9:52 AM - karthikpm52: And it's difficult to understand that also. <This message was edited>
7/21/25, 9:52 AM - karthikpm52: Like in their life
7/21/25, 9:52 AM - karthikpm52: They never got loved in their childhood.
7/21/25, 9:53 AM - karthikpm52: So they are expressing their care.
7/21/25, 9:53 AM - karthikpm52: In however way possible.
7/21/25, 9:53 AM - Kanika Bhat: Yes credit goes to them also. They r good people. 
Ig they understood, but they didnt express. They just let u be
7/21/25, 9:53 AM - karthikpm52: That's why I feel when my father gives me something, I understand the love.
7/21/25, 9:53 AM - Kanika Bhat: Or maybe they actually didn’t understand
7/21/25, 9:54 AM - karthikpm52: And when kanika said, her dad adjusted her shirt .. I feel he did it like that.
7/21/25, 9:55 AM - karthikpm52: Like he was raised without love maybe, but he wants to show it.
7/21/25, 9:55 AM - karthikpm52: Like this.
7/21/25, 9:55 AM - karthikpm52: Idk
7/21/25, 9:55 AM - karthikpm52: I feel it's like that.
7/21/25, 9:56 AM - Kanika Bhat: He was raised with love but his work has made him too professional.
7/21/25, 9:57 AM - karthikpm52: <Media omitted>
7/21/25, 9:57 AM - karthikpm52: Ohhhhhhh
7/21/25, 9:57 AM - Kanika Bhat: Yup
7/21/25, 9:57 AM - karthikpm52: I get the picture.
7/21/25, 9:58 AM - karthikpm52: Woww thank you 😭
7/21/25, 9:58 AM - Kanika Bhat: *Jenya closes her notebook
7/21/25, 9:59 AM - karthikpm52: Yeah, i think it was for the best!

7/22/25, 12:38 PM - Kanika Bhat: It merges with Indus river
7/22/25, 12:38 PM - karthikpm52: Sounds pretty innocent
7/22/25, 12:38 PM - Kanika Bhat: And both river colors r so different from each other
7/22/25, 12:38 PM - karthikpm52: Really?
7/22/25, 12:38 PM - karthikpm52: Like how?

7/22/25, 12:50 PM - karthikpm52: Killed them
7/22/25, 12:50 PM - karthikpm52: Because he wanted to promote his shiva god.
7/22/25, 12:51 PM - karthikpm52: Like you can see how crazy religion can be.
7/22/25, 12:51 PM - karthikpm52: Woahhh

7/22/25, 12:51 PM - karthikpm52: Ngl

7/22/25, 12:52 PM - Kanika Bhat: Hehe

7/22/25, 12:53 PM - karthikpm52: I think nobody can top that.
7/22/25, 12:53 PM - karthikpm52: In this world rn
7/22/25, 12:53 PM - karthikpm52: Like he jumped from a freking mountain!

7/22/25, 12:53 PM - karthikpm52: And the passion. <This message was edited>
7/22/25, 12:54 PM - karthikpm52: Like he couldn't hold it in.
7/22/25, 12:54 PM - karthikpm52: And just let it out.
7/22/25, 12:54 PM - Kanika Bhat: I wish,
I could give him a stone with my name written on it..

Cuz i couldnt see flowers in Ladakh 

And actually i just realised
Name written on stone is much better.
Now its there permanently 
It wont fade away like a flower.
7/22/25, 12:54 PM - karthikpm52: Then he will keep remembering about you right?
7/22/25, 12:55 PM - karthikpm52: Isn't that what you don't want?
7/22/25, 12:55 PM - karthikpm52: Him thinking about you, cuz it's gonna hurt?
7/22/25, 12:56 PM - Kanika Bhat: Like
I would just walk with him endlessly wherever he takes me.
And we dont say a word to each other
We r just out there in the nature and we both would know we r interacting internally. 

So many thoughts of raw love flooding into our mind and heart
But outside the body, is pure silence
7/22/25, 12:56 PM - Kanika Bhat: If i end up being with him
7/22/25, 12:56 PM - karthikpm52: Achaa
7/22/25, 12:56 PM - karthikpm52: Man it seems like you might have written a poem about him? <This message was edited>
7/22/25, 12:57 PM - karthikpm52: Did you?
7/22/25, 12:57 PM - karthikpm52: I feel you did

7/22/25, 12:58 PM - karthikpm52: And when did you go to ladakh?
7/22/25, 12:58 PM - Kanika Bhat: When i was in a situationship with saharsh..
I wanted him 
But i was kept hanging
7/22/25, 12:58 PM - karthikpm52: Wait, like you are thinking about him right now... Won't he be thinking about you?
7/22/25, 12:59 PM - Kanika Bhat: Ummmmm longgg time back

Idk when now
7/22/25, 1:00 PM - karthikpm52: I feel you should write about him.

7/22/25, 1:04 PM - Kanika Bhat: <Media omitted>
7/22/25, 1:06 PM - Kanika Bhat: It means ki
This is just a pencil
Which sacrifices itself bt death just because the writer wanted to let their words out.
7/22/25, 1:06 PM - Kanika Bhat: Means pencil/pen
7/22/25, 1:06 PM - karthikpm52: Idw it feels like one of those moments when I was stuck in life, and has to take a leap for faith, i submitted my anxiety to a higher cause and jumped in.
7/22/25, 1:07 PM - karthikpm52: Like higer power
7/22/25, 1:07 PM - Kanika Bhat: 😮 gooood naaaa
7/22/25, 1:07 PM - Kanika Bhat: Yea
The god u prayed to
Was nothing but your own will power and intentions which helped u get out of the problem
7/22/25, 1:07 PM - Kanika Bhat: Thats y in the poem 
I said
Intensions and gods are the same
7/22/25, 1:07 PM - karthikpm52: But when I didn't tap inside my soul, i felt like I couldn't move like everything was dead.
7/22/25, 1:08 PM - karthikpm52: Like i tend to submit to materialistic natures of mine.
7/22/25, 1:08 PM - Kanika Bhat: <Media omitted>
7/22/25, 1:08 PM - karthikpm52: Fear, anxiety, anger etc.

7/22/25, 1:20 PM - karthikpm52: Yaaa
7/22/25, 1:21 PM - karthikpm52: But why did you write it? What was the motivation?
7/22/25, 1:21 PM - karthikpm52: To write this?
7/22/25, 1:21 PM - Kanika Bhat: Like
Whenever someone wants to read my poems
I deliberately dont share this one to them even thi this is one my best works..

Because ik, they dont hv the patience to read and re-read to understand the true meaning.
They just wanna hv the “woAahh” moment as if its a shayri.

But in your case 
Ik u hv the patience to absorb the words.
And its one of the topics u talk the most about.
7/22/25, 1:23 PM - Kanika Bhat: I seeee 
Yes disassociation.
Makes sense.
7/22/25, 1:24 PM - Kanika Bhat: U r the perfect bro 🥳
7/22/25, 1:24 PM - Kanika Bhat: Yess exactlyyyy
7/22/25, 1:25 PM - karthikpm52: Yaa i actually love talking stuff related to this, and getting to know about people who matter depth, like that why I am very close with sai, like we always talk about this kinda stuff.
7/22/25, 1:24 PM - Kanika Bhat: We lose focus
7/22/25, 1:25 PM - karthikpm52: Like i wanna feel love, not like from a romantic point of view, like anything.
7/22/25, 1:26 PM - Kanika Bhat: Haaaannn
Thank god 
U understood the poem..
Im happy 
Like i got a validation.
Poem feels worth the effort, cuz i had to make efforts to contrast the “intentions” with “gods”

Thanks so much karthik.
7/22/25, 1:26 PM - karthikpm52: When my father gives me chana, ya when my mother checks my temperature, ya when my brother called me and idiot, ya when ram sir said I am like him, or when you said i matter and the possession.
7/22/25, 1:26 PM - Kanika Bhat: My mind was idle. 
Thoughts flowed in and out
7/22/25, 1:26 PM - karthikpm52: Like i love itt
7/22/25, 1:26 PM - Kanika Bhat: I was in 10th when i wrote this.
I was preparing for boards
7/22/25, 1:27 PM - karthikpm52: <Media omitted>
7/22/25, 1:27 PM - Kanika Bhat: Oh i get ittt
7/22/25, 1:27 PM - Kanika Bhat: Hnn
7/22/25, 1:27 PM - Kanika Bhat: The connection
7/22/25, 1:27 PM - karthikpm52: Exactly
7/22/25, 1:27 PM - karthikpm52: I mean romantic is also fine.
7/22/25, 1:28 PM - karthikpm52: But it's depth.
7/22/25, 1:28 PM - karthikpm52: Like i said it before right.
7/22/25, 1:28 PM - Kanika Bhat: But then theres love (connection) 
But then theres love (soulmate) 

Its not the same.
We need both.
7/22/25, 1:28 PM - Kanika Bhat: And romance is just 1% of soulmate
7/22/25, 1:28 PM - karthikpm52: So it's not about erectile dysfunction form what I said that day hahaha.
7/22/25, 1:29 PM - karthikpm52: Like people take time to show attachment.
7/22/25, 1:29 PM - Kanika Bhat: The major part is
Being there for them during their thick and then
Sacrifices 
Compromises
Leaving own’s perspective to understand their’s
Trust
7/22/25, 1:30 PM - karthikpm52: Like i just love feelings that.
7/22/25, 1:30 PM - karthikpm52: Maybe i might get heartbroken a thousand times.
7/22/25, 1:30 PM - karthikpm52: But it's fine.
7/22/25, 1:30 PM - karthikpm52: As long as I can feel
7/22/25, 1:30 PM - karthikpm52: Ohhhh
7/22/25, 1:31 PM - Kanika Bhat: Ig
Lord Krishna said
“If u love someone, give them freedom. Because freedom is the most important thing for every living being”

He said this when he was explaining Radha why he cant be with her even tho he loves her..

7/22/25, 1:31 PM - karthikpm52: But that's because of other reasons
7/22/25, 1:31 PM - karthikpm52: But radha was different.
7/22/25, 1:31 PM - karthikpm52: Ig she had her duties
7/22/25, 1:32 PM - karthikpm52: And he had his.
7/22/25, 1:32 PM - Kanika Bhat: Areh yes

7/22/25, 1:32 PM - karthikpm52: So sometimes it's about what's right.
7/22/25, 1:32 PM - karthikpm52: Like at that time he had bigger weights to serve his people.
7/22/25, 1:33 PM - Kanika Bhat: Yup but its so heart breaking..

7/22/25, 1:35 PM - karthikpm52: Exactly

7/23/25, 9:31 PM - karthikpm52: <Media omitted>
7/23/25, 9:31 PM - Kanika Bhat: U need to improve here,
Researchers need the ability to constantly read and read between the lines.
7/23/25, 9:32 PM - Kanika Bhat: Bored = lack of dopamine = distracted by topics which give u dopamine
7/23/25, 9:32 PM - karthikpm52: <Media omitted>
7/23/25, 9:32 PM - karthikpm52: Exactly 💯
7/23/25, 9:33 PM - Kanika Bhat: So thats your routine
7/23/25, 9:34 PM - Kanika Bhat: Woaaahh
7/23/25, 9:34 PM - Kanika Bhat: I agree. 
The decorum and environment
7/23/25, 9:36 PM - Kanika Bhat: What are the activities u do during the day that help u slow down for a bit, get calm and think about life (not overthink) just introspecting planning your goals and future.

Tell me
7/23/25, 9:36 PM - Kanika Bhat: That one activity 
Where u tend to find the answers to your questions
7/23/25, 9:36 PM - karthikpm52: <Media omitted>
7/23/25, 9:37 PM - karthikpm52: My routine!
7/23/25, 9:37 PM - Kanika Bhat: Ok 
I suggest
U should consciously start talking a bit slowly. Reduce your speed of talking.
7/23/25, 9:37 PM - karthikpm52: Why is that?
7/23/25, 9:37 PM - Kanika Bhat: .
7/23/25, 9:38 PM - karthikpm52: Cuz i missed you 🥺
7/23/25, 9:39 PM - karthikpm52: Cuz that's one time when I feel so good!
7/23/25, 9:39 PM - Kanika Bhat: What? Fever?
7/23/25, 9:39 PM - karthikpm52: Like, sometimes if you lift a lot your body temperature increases, and get feverish.
7/23/25, 9:39 PM - karthikpm52: Like with pain.
7/23/25, 9:40 PM - karthikpm52: In the muscles.
7/23/25, 9:40 PM - karthikpm52: Which is good.
7/23/25, 9:40 PM - Kanika Bhat: For how long do u use your phone?
7/23/25, 9:41 PM - Kanika Bhat: “After that i talk to u” was so cute 🥹 
Like..
As if im part of your routine
7/23/25, 9:43 PM - karthikpm52: I use my phone the rest of the time probably, like all my notes are there, and I journal also in that, or time wasters. Like the only time that I don't use the phone that much is when I am in class or gym, or when I am doing something like reading, ya using my laptop.
7/23/25, 9:43 PM - karthikpm52: I just random things on Google.
7/23/25, 9:44 PM - Kanika Bhat: Think and tell me

a person is talking too fast, frequently drifting away from main topic…

V/s
A person speaking with deep voice, slightly slow speech and staying to the point, explaining things just right.

Out of these two people
Who’s most likely to be hyperactive?
7/23/25, 9:44 PM - karthikpm52: Yaaaa.
7/23/25, 9:45 PM - karthikpm52: I mean when it comes to hyperactive it's the first person for sure. <This message was edited>
7/23/25, 9:45 PM - Kanika Bhat: 🥺
I was missing u too..

Ps:- that was the real reason y i called u from my friend’s phone in the name of a “prank call” 

*runs away in shyness after telling u the truth
7/23/25, 9:46 PM - karthikpm52: *Me chase back
7/23/25, 9:47 PM - karthikpm52: Like that was so sweet of you yaar, like i wasn't even expecting.. like it was your voice but i didn't believe it was you tbh, like different number, and acting like a stranger.
7/23/25, 9:47 PM - Kanika Bhat: 🥹
Im here for u, Karthik. Always.
U could hv spammed txt me, i would hv read them cuz maybe i would feel it in my gut that u wanna talk.

It will make u feel lighter
U can txt me anytime and anything.
7/23/25, 9:48 PM - Kanika Bhat: Delete insta. It actually helps. Insta makes us stupid.
7/23/25, 9:48 PM - Kanika Bhat: Yaa 🥲 <This message was edited>
7/23/25, 9:49 PM - karthikpm52: Like, i could feel your sarcasm energy, like idk how to tell you this, but I just kept asking questions to verify!
7/23/25, 9:49 PM - karthikpm52: Like you smile!
7/23/25, 9:49 PM - karthikpm52: And all
7/23/25, 9:49 PM - Kanika Bhat: Breaks eye contact due to shyness**
7/23/25, 9:50 PM - karthikpm52: Yaaar I am text spammer at core, but i restrict so much, like when you said you want to text spam me I was like i think you should kynki I am also that 😭
7/23/25, 9:50 PM - karthikpm52: *doesn't let you break eye contact.
7/23/25, 9:51 PM - Kanika Bhat: Yes
Also, when u talk a little slowly, u tend to think deeper on what u r saying.
U get enough time to process what u r saying also observe the Listener’s reactions to your content.

It shoots up the Teller’s confidence in no time. 
Trust me.
Ive done this.
7/23/25, 9:51 PM - karthikpm52: <Media omitted>
7/23/25, 9:51 PM - Kanika Bhat: No aaaAaahhhh
*Keeps looking at the floor cuz she definitely cant look at u
7/23/25, 9:53 PM - Kanika Bhat: Hehe
But u guessed me in no time..
And i was internally happy to hear your voice after so long and i was slightly blushing when u guessed it was me on call 🫣

*runs away againnnn 
Throws pillows at u
7/23/25, 9:53 PM - karthikpm52: I do that, but with you sometimes I tend to lose it, so i just say fast.. but it doesn't even make sense, like i am in a hurry to tell you everything.
7/23/25, 9:53 PM - karthikpm52: But i mean this hyperactive weirdness is part of me, but
7/23/25, 9:53 PM - karthikpm52: You are right, I have tame the demon!!!
7/23/25, 9:54 PM - Kanika Bhat: U said “yaar” for the first time.
Did this confession impact u deeply?
7/23/25, 9:54 PM - Kanika Bhat: Hehehe
7/23/25, 9:54 PM - karthikpm52: *runs faster and motivates to look at me!
7/23/25, 9:55 PM - karthikpm52: Damn you are really good at observing, yes ofc .. like i also didn't notice this!
7/23/25, 9:56 PM - karthikpm52: Hahaha, I loved when you said "maybe" every time 😂!
7/23/25, 9:56 PM - Kanika Bhat: Dont hold back.

All your sides 
Sarcastic,
Religious 
Dark
Scared
Ambitious 

And i will always tell u your SWOT analysis.
I want u to grow better as a person.
7/23/25, 9:56 PM - karthikpm52: Btw no cap, like when I saw the missed call, I was kinda hoping it was you, but i was also not expecting it at the same time!!
7/23/25, 9:56 PM - karthikpm52: Because i don't call back unknown numbers.
7/23/25, 9:56 PM - karthikpm52: Especially from delhi.
7/23/25, 9:57 PM - karthikpm52: Kynki like far away calls are mostly scam calls😂
7/23/25, 9:57 PM - Kanika Bhat: How will u do that if i close my eyes and cover then from my palms.
Cuz yes i do get shyyyyyy 😩😩😩😩 like rn also.
7/23/25, 9:57 PM - Kanika Bhat: Behind the screen my heart is racing and im shy
7/23/25, 9:58 PM - karthikpm52: Man, you the best.. you give me unfiltered options on myself, so that I can self reflect myself, like i always wonder how people perceive me, so it's really amazing that you don't hold back! That's why I keep saying you are rare.
7/23/25, 9:59 PM - karthikpm52: Look at meee !!!!!!
7/23/25, 9:59 PM - Kanika Bhat: Karthik..
Delete it for 1 day per week. Thats all.
